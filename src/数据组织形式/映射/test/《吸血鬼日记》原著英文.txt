"Are you having a good time?" Elena asked. 
I am now. Stefan didn't say it, but Elena knew it was what he was thinking. She could see it in the way 
he stared at her. She had never been so sure of her power. Except that actually he didn't look as if he 
were having a good time; he looked stricken, in pain, as if he couldn't take one more minute of this. 


The band was starting up, a slow dance. He was still staring at her, drinking her in. Those green eyes 
darkening, going black with desire. She had the sudden feeling that he might jerk her to him and kiss her 
hard, without ever saying a word. 


"Would you like to dance?" she said softly. I'm playing with fire, with something I don't understand, she 
thought suddenly. And in that instant she realized that she was frightened. Her heart began to pound 
violently. It was as if those green eyes spoke to some part of her that was buried deep beneath the 
surface-and that part was screaming "danger" at her. Some instinct older than civilization was telling her 
to run, to flee. 


She didn't move.

The Awakening 
Chapter One 
^ &raquo; 
September 4 
Dear Diary, 
Something awful is going to happen today. 
I don't know why I wrote that. It's crazy. There's no reason for me to be upset and every reason 


for me to be happy, but... 
But here I am at 5:30 in the morning, awake and scared. I keep telling myself it's just that I'm all 


messed up from the time difference between France and here. But that doesn't explain why I feel 
so scared. So lost. 
The day before yesterday, while Aunt Judith and Margaret and I were driving back from the 

airport, I had such a strange feeling. When we turned onto our street I suddenly thought, "Mom 
and Dad are waiting for us at home. I bet they'll be on the front porch or in the living room 
looking out the window. They must have missed me so much." 

I know. That sounds totally crazy. 

Page 2 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
But even when I saw the house and the empty front porch I still felt that way. I ran up the steps 
and I tried the door and knocked with the knocker. And when Aunt Judith unlocked the door I 
burst inside and just stood in the hallway listening, expecting to hear Mom coming down the stairs 
or Dad calling from the den. 

Just then Aunt Judith let a suitcase crash down on the floor behind me and sighed a huge sigh and 
said, "We're home." And Margaret laughed. And the most horrible feeling I've ever felt in my life 
came over me. I've never felt so utterly and completely lost. 

Home. I'm home. Why does that sound like a he? 


I was born here in Fell's Church. I've always lived in this house, always. This is my same old 
bedroom, with the scorch mark on the floorboards where Caroline and I tried to sneak cigarettes 
in 5th grade and nearly choked ourselves. I can look out the window and see the big quince tree 
Matt and the guys climbed up to crash my birthday slumber party two years ago. This is my bed, 
my chair, my dresser.

I was too tired yesterday to go to Orientation. 

Meredith picked up my schedule for me, but I didn't feel like talking to her on the phone. Aunt 
Judith told everyone who called that I had jet lag and was sleeping, but she watched me at dinner 
with a funny look on her face. 

I've got to see the crowd today, though. We're supposed to meet in the parking lot before school. 
Is that why I'm scared? Am I frightened of them? 

Elena Gilbert stopped writing. She stared at the last line she had written and then shook her head, pen 
hovering over the small book with the blue velvet cover. Then, with a sudden gesture, she lifted her head 
and threw pen and book at the big bay window, where they bounced off harmlessly and landed on the 
upholstered window seat. 

It was all so completely ridiculous. 

Since when had she, Elena Gilbert, been scared of meeting people? Since when had she been scared of 
anything? She stood up and angrily thrust her arms into a red silk kimono. She didn't even glance at the 
elaborate Victorian mirror above the cherrywood dresser; she knew what she'd see. Elena Gilbert, cool 
and blond and slender, the fashion trendsetter, the high school senior, the girl every boy wanted and 
every girl wanted to be. Who just now had an unaccustomed scowl on her face and a pinch to her 
mouth. 

A hot bath and some coffee and I'll calm down, she thought. The morning ritual of washing and dressing 
was soothing, and she dawdled over it, sorting through her new outfits from Paris. She finally chose a 
pale rose top and white linen shorts combo that made her look like a raspberry sundae. Good enough to 

Page 3 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
eat, she thought, and the mirror showed a girl with a secret smile. Her earlier fears had melted away, 
forgotten. 

"Elena! Where are you? You're going to be late for school!" The voice drifted faintly up from below. 
Elena ran the brush one more time through silky hair and pulled it back with a deep rose ribbon. Then she 
grabbed her backpack and went down the stairs. 

In the kitchen, four-year-old Margaret was eating cereal at the kitchen table, and Aunt Judith was 
burning something on the stove. Aunt Judith was the sort of woman who always looked vaguely flustered; 
she had a thin, mild face and light flyaway hair pushed back untidily. Elena landed a peck on her cheek. 

"Good morning, everybody. Sorry I don't have time for breakfast." 
"But, Elena, you can't just go off without eating. You need your protein-" 
"I'll get a doughnut before school," said Elena briskly. She dropped a kiss on Margaret's tow head and 
. 


turned to go. 
turned to go. 
"And I'll probably go home with Bonnie or Meredith after school, so don't wait dinner. Bye!" 
"Elena-" 
Elena was already at the front door. She closed it behind her, cutting off Aunt Judith's distant protests, 


and stepped out onto the front porch. 
And stopped. 
All the bad feelings of the morning rushed over her again. The anxiety, the fear. And the certainty that 


something terrible was about to happen. 
Maple Street was deserted. The tall Victorian houses looked strange and silent, as if they might all be 


empty inside, like the houses on an abandoned movie set. They looked as if they were empty of people, 
but full of strange watching things. 
That was it; something was watching her. The sky overhead was not blue but milky and opaque, like a 


giant bowl turned upside down. 
The air was stifling, and Elena felt sure that there were eyes on her. 
She caught sight of something dark in the branches of the old quince tree in front of the house. 
It was a crow, sitting as still as the yellow-tinged leaves around it. And it was the thing watching her. 
She tried to tell herself that this was ridiculous, but somehow she knew. It was the biggest crow she had 


ever seen, plump and sleek, with rainbows shining in its black feathers. She could see every detail of it 
clearly: the greedy dark claws, the sharp beak, the single glittering black eye. 

Page 4 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
It was so motionless that it might have been a wax model of a bird sitting there. But as she stared at it, 
Elena felt herself flush slowly, heat coming in waves up her throat and cheeks. Because it was... looking 
at her. Looking the way boys looked at her when she wore a bathing suit or a sheer blouse. As if it were 
undressing her with its eyes. 

Before she realized what she was doing, she had dropped her backpack and picked up a stone from 
beside the driveway. "Get out of here," she said, and heard the shaking anger in her own voice. "Go on! 
Get away!" With the last word, she threw the stone. 

There was an explosion of leaves, but the crow soared up unharmed. Its wings were huge, and they 
made enough racket for a whole flock of crows. Elena crouched, suddenly panicked as it flapped directly 
over her head, the wind of its wings ruffling her blond hair. 

But it swooped up again and circled, a black silhouette against the paper-white sky. Then, with one harsh 
croak, it wheeled away toward the woods. 

Elena straightened up slowly, then glanced around, self-conscious. She couldn't believe what she had just 
done. But now that the bird was gone, the sky felt ordinary again. A little wind made the leaves flutter, 
and Elena took a deep breath. Down the street a door opened and several children poured out, laughing. 

She smiled at them, and took another breath, relief sweeping through her like sunlight. How could she 
have been so silly? This was a beautiful day, full of promise, and nothing bad was going to happen. 


Nothing bad was going to happen-except that she was going to be late getting to school. The whole 
crowd would be waiting for her in the parking lot. 

Nothing bad was going to happen-except that she was going to be late getting to school. The whole 
crowd would be waiting for her in the parking lot. 

Without a backward glance at the quince tree, she began to walk as quickly as she could down the 
street. 

The crow crashed through the top of the massive oak, and Stefan's head jerked up reflexively. When he 
saw it was only a bird, he relaxed. 

His eyes dropped to the limp white form in his hands, and he felt his face twist in regret. He hadn't meant 
to kill it. He would have hunted something larger than a rabbit if he'd known how hungry he was. But, of 
course, that was the very thing that frightened him: never knowing how strong the hunger would be, or 
what he might have to do to satisfy it. He was lucky that this time he'd killed only a rabbit. 

He stood beneath the ancient oak trees, sunlight filtering down onto his curly hair. In jeans and T-shirt, 
Stefan Salvatore looked exactly like a normal high school student. 

He wasn't. 

Deep in the woods, where no one would see him, he'd come to feed. Now he licked at his gums and lips 
painstakingly, to make sure there was no stain on them. He didn't want to take any chances. This 
masquerade was going to be hard enough to pull off as it was. 

Page 5 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
For a moment he wondered, again, if he should just give it all up. Perhaps he should go back to Italy, 
back to his hiding place. What made him think that he could rejoin the world of daylight? 

But he was tired of living in shadows. He was tired of the darkness, and of the things that lived in it. Most 
of all, he was tired of being alone. 

He wasn't sure why he'd chosen Fell's Church, Virginia. It was a young town, by his standards; the oldest 
buildings had been put up only a century and a half ago. But memories and ghosts of the Civil War still 
lived here, as real as the supermarkets and fast-food joints. 

Stefan appreciated respect for the past. He thought he might come to like the people of Fell's Church. 
And perhaps-just perhaps-he might find a place among them. 

He'd never be accepted completely, of course. A bitter smile curved his lips at the idea. He knew better 
than to hope for that. There would never be a place where he could belong completely, where he could 
truly be himself. 

Unless he chose to belong to the shadows... 

He slapped the thought away. He'd renounced the darkness; he'd left the shadows behind him. He was 
blotting all those long years out and starting afresh, today. 

Stefan realized he was still holding the rabbit. Gently, he laid it down on the bed of brown oak leaves. 
Far away, too far for human ears to pick up, he recognized the noises of a fox. 

Come along, brother hunter, he thought sadly. Your breakfast is waiting. 


As he slung his jacket over his shoulder, he noticed the crow that had disturbed him earlier. It was still 
perched in the oak tree, and it seemed to be watching him. There was a wrongness about it. 

As he slung his jacket over his shoulder, he noticed the crow that had disturbed him earlier. It was still 
perched in the oak tree, and it seemed to be watching him. There was a wrongness about it. 

Moving almost silently among the dead leaves and dry twigs, he made his way toward the edge of the 
woods. His car was parked there. He glanced back, once, and saw that the crow had left the branches 
and dropped down on the rabbit. 

There was something sinister in the way it spread its wings over the limp white body, something sinister 
and triumphant. Stefan's throat tightened, and he almost strode back to chase the bird away. Still, it had 
as much right to eat as the fox did, he told himself. 

As much right as he did. 

If he encountered the bird again, he'd look into its mind, he decided. Just now, he tore his eyes from the 
sight of it and hurried on through the woods, jaw set. He didn't want to be late arriving at Robert E. Lee 
High School.

Elena was surrounded the instant she stepped into the high school parking lot. Everyone was there, the 
whole crowd she hadn't seen since late June, plus four or five hangers-on who hoped to gain popularity 
by association. One by one she accepted the welcoming hugs of her own group. 


Caroline had grown at least an inch and was slinkier and more like a Vogue model than ever. She 
greeted Elena coolly and stepped back again with her green eyes narrowed like a cat's. 


Bonnie hadn't grown at all, and her curly red head barely came up to Elena's chin as she flung her arms 
around Elena. Wait a minute-curls? thought Elena. She pushed the smaller girl back. 


"Bonnie! What did you do to your hair?" 


"Do you like it? I think it makes me look taller." Bonnie fluffed up the already fluffy bangs and smiled, her 
brown eyes sparkling with excitement, her little heart-shaped face alight. 


Elena moved on. "Meredith. You haven't changed at all." 


This hug was equally warm on both sides. She had missed Meredith more than anyone, Elena thought, 
looking at the tall girl. Meredith never wore any makeup; but then, with perfect olive skin and heavy 
black lashes, she didn't need any. Right now she had one elegant eyebrow raised as she studied Elena. 


"Well, your hair is two shades lighter from the sun... But where's your tan? I thought you were living it up 
on the French Riviera." 


"You know I never tan." Elena held up her hands for her own inspection. The skin was flawless, like 


. 
porcelain, but almost as fair and translucent as Bonnie's. 
"Just a minute; that reminds me," Bonnie interjected, snatching one of Elena's hands. "Guess what I 


learned from my cousin this summer?" Before anyone could speak, she informed them triumphantly: 
"Palm reading!" 
There were groans, and some laughter. 
"Laugh while you can," said Bonnie, not at all disturbed. "My cousin told me I'm psychic. Now, let me 


see..." She peered into Elena's palm. 
"Hurry up or we're going to be late," said Elena a bit impatiently. 
"All right, all right. Now, this is your life line-or is it your heart line?" In the crowd, someone snickered. 


"Quiet; I'm reaching into the void. I see... I see..." All at once, Bonnie's face went blank, as if she were 
startled. Her brown eyes widened, but she no longer seemed to be staring at Elena's hand. It was as if 
she were looking through it-at something frightening. 


"You will meet a tall, dark stranger," Meredith murmured from behind her. There was a flurry of giggles. 
"Dark, yes, and a stranger... but not tall." Bonnie's voice was hushed and faraway. 
"Although," she continued after a moment, looking puzzled, "he was tall, once." Her wide brown eyes 


Page 7 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
lifted to Elena's in bewilderment. "But that's impossible... isn't it?" She dropped Elena's hand, almost 


flinging it away. "I don't want to see any more." 
"Okay, show's over. Let's go," Elena told the others, vaguely irritated. She'd always felt psychic tricks 
were just that-tricks. So why was she annoyed? Just because that morning she'd almost freaked out 
herself... 


The girls started toward the school building, but the roar of a finely tuned motor stopped them all in their 
tracks. 
"Well, now," Caroline said, staring. "Quite a car." 


"Quite a Porsche," Meredith corrected dryly. 
The sleek black 911 Turbo purred through the parking lot, searching for a space, moving as lazily as a 
panther stalking prey. 


When the car came to a stop, the door opened, and they glimpsed the driver. 
"Oh, my God," Caroline whispered. 
"You can say that again," breathed Bonnie. 
From where she stood, Elena could see he had a lean, flat-muscled body. Faded jeans he probably had 


to peel off at night, tight T-shirt, and a leather jacket of unusual cut. His hair was wavy-and dark. 
He wasn't tall, though. Just average height. 
Elena let out her breath. 
"Who is that masked man?" said Meredith. And the remark was apt-dark sunglasses completely 


covered the boy's eyes, shielding his face like a mask. 


. 
"That masked stranger," someone else said, and a babble of voices rose up. 


"That masked stranger," someone else said, and a babble of voices rose up. 


"How would you know? You've never been farther than Rome, New York, in your life!" 


"Uh-oh. Elena's got that look again. The hunting look." 


"Short-Dark-and-Handsome had better be careful." 


"He isn't short; he's perfect!" 


Through the chatter, Caroline's voice suddenly rang out. "Oh, come on, Elena. You've already got Matt. 
What more do you want? What can you do with two that you can't do with one?" 


Page 8 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
"The same thing-only longer," drawled Meredith, and the group dissolved into laughter. 


The boy had locked his car and was walking toward school. Casually, Elena started after him, the other 
girls right behind her in a close-knit pack. For an instant, annoyance bubbled up inside her. Couldn't she 
go anywhere without a parade on her heels? But Meredith caught her eye, and she smiled in spite of 
herself. 


"Noblesse oblige," Meredith said softly. 


"What?" 


"If you're going to be queen of the school, you have to put up with the consequences." 


Elena frowned at this as they entered the building. A long corridor stretched before them, and a figure in 
jeans and leather jacket was disappearing through the office doorway up ahead. Elena slowed her pace 
as she walked up to the office, finally stopping to glance thoughtfully at the messages on the cork bulletin 
board by the door. There was a large window here, through which the entire office was visible. 


The other girls were openly gazing through the window, and giggling. "Nice rear view." "That is definitely 
an Armani jacket." "You think he's from out of state?" 


Elena was straining her ears for the boy's name. There seemed to be some kind of trouble in there: Mrs. 
Clarke, the admissions secretary, was looking at a list and shaking her head. The boy said something, 
and Mrs. Clarke lifted her hands in a "What can I say?" gesture. She ran a finger down the list and shook 
her head again, conclusively. The boy started to turn away, then turned back. And when Mrs. Clarke 
looked up at him, her expression changed. 


The boy's sunglasses were now in his hand. Mrs. Clarke seemed startled by something; Elena could see 
her blink several times. Her lips opened and closed as if she were trying to speak. 


Elena wished she could see more than the back of the boy's head. Mrs. Clarke was fumbling through 
piles of paper now, looking dazed. At last she found a form of some kind and wrote on it, then turned it 
around and pushed it toward the boy. 


The boy wrote briefly on the form-signing it, probably-and returned it. Mrs. Clarke stared at it a 
second, then fumbled through a new pile of papers, finally handing what looked like a class schedule to 
him. Her eyes never left the boy as he took it, inclined his head in thanks, and turned to the door. 


Elena was wild with curiosity by now. What had just happened in there? And what did this stranger's 
face look like? But as he emerged from the office, he was settling his sunglasses in place again. 


. 
Disappointment coursed through her. 


Disappointment coursed through her. 


Most of them were turning away from the boy now, looking anywhere but at him. Elena held her place by 
the window and gave a little toss to her head, pulling the ribbon out of her hair so that it fell loose around 
her shoulders. 


Without looking to either side, the boy moved on down the hallway. A chorus of sighs and whispers 


Page 9 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
flared up the moment he was out of earshot. 
Elena didn't hear any of it. 
He'd walked right by her, she thought, dazed. Right by without a glance. 
Dimly, she realized the bell was ringing. Meredith was tugging her arm. 
"What?" 
"I said here's your schedule. We've got trig on the second floor right now. Come on!" 
Elena allowed Meredith to propel her down the corridor, up a flight of stairs, and into a classroom. She 


slid into an empty seat automatically and fixed her eyes on the teacher at the front without really seeing 


her. The shock still hadn't worn off. 
He'd walked right by. Without a glance. She couldn't remember how long it had been since a boy had 
done that. They all looked, at least. Some whistled. Some stopped to talk. Some just stared. 


And that had always been fine with Elena. 
After all, what was more important than boys? They were the mark of how popular you were, of how 


beautiful you were. And they could be useful for all sorts of things. Sometimes they were exciting, but 
usually that didn't last long. Sometimes they were creeps from the beginning. 
Most boys, Elena reflected, were like puppies. Adorable in their place, but expendable. A very few 

could be more than that, could become real friends. Like Matt. 
Oh, Matt. Last year she'd hoped that he was the one she was looking for, the boy who could make her 
feel... well, something more. More than the rush of triumph at making a conquest, the pride in showing 

your new acquisition off to the other girls. And she had come to feel a strong affection for Matt. But over 
the summer, when she'd had time to think, she'd realized it was the affection of a cousin or sister. 
Ms. Halpern was passing out trigonometry books. Elena took hers mechanically and wrote her name 

inside, still wrapped in thought. 

She liked Matt more than any other boy she'd known. And that was why she was going to have to tell 
him it was over. 
She hadn't known how to tell him in a letter. She didn't know how to tell him now. It wasn't that she was 

afraid he'd kick up a fuss; he just wouldn't understand. She didn't really understand herself. 

It was as if she were always reaching for... something. Only, when she thought she'd got it, it wasn't 

there. Not with Matt, not with any of the boys she'd had. 
And then she had to start all over again. Fortunately, there was always fresh material. No boy had ever 
resisted her successfully, and no boy had ever ignored her. Until now.

L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
Until now. Remembering that moment in the hall, Elena found that her fingers were clenched on the pen 

she held. She still couldn't believe he'd brushed by her that way. 
The bell rang and everyone flooded out of the classroom, but Elena paused in the doorway. She bit her 
lip, scanning the river of students flowing through the hall. Then she spotted one of the hangers-on from 
the parking lot. 


"Frances! Come here." 
Frances came eagerly, her plain face brightening. 
"Listen, Frances, you remember that boy this morning?" 
"With the Porsche and the-er-assets? How could I forget?" 
"Well, I want his class schedule. Get it from the office if you can, or copy it from him if you have to. But 


do it!" 


Frances looked surprised for a moment, then grinned and nodded. "Okay, Elena. I'll try. I'll meet you at 
lunch if I can get it." 
"Thanks." Elena watched the girl go. 
"You know, you really are crazy," Meredith's voice said in her ear. 
"What's the use of being queen of the school if you can't pull a little rank sometimes?" returned Elena 


calmly. "Where do I go now?" 


"General Business. Here, take it yourself." Meredith thrust a schedule at her. "I've got to run for 
chemistry. Later!" 
General Business and the rest of the morning passed in a blur. Elena had hoped to catch another glimpse 


of the new student, but he was in none of her classes. Matt was in one, and she felt a pang as his blue 


eyes met hers with a smile. 
At the lunch bell, she nodded greetings right and left as she walked to the cafeteria. Caroline was outside, 
posed casually against a wall with chin up, shoulders back, hips forward. The two boys she was talking 
to fell silent and nudged each other as Elena approached. 


"Hi," Elena said briefly to the boys; and to Caroline: "Ready to go in and eat?" 


Caroline's green eyes barely flickered toward Elena, and she pushed glossy auburn hair out of her face. 
"What, at the royal table?" she said. 
Elena was taken aback. She and Caroline had been friends since kindergarten, and they had always 


1 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
competed with each other good-naturedly. But lately something had happened to Caroline. She'd begun 
to take the rivalry more and more seriously. And now Elena was surprised at the bitterness in the other 
girl's voice. 


. 
"Well, it's hardly as if you were a commoner," she said lightly. 


"Well, it's hardly as if you were a commoner," she said lightly. 
Caroline didn't seem to notice. "A lot of things changed while you were gone this summer, Elena," she 
continued. "And just maybe your time on the throne is running out." 


Elena had flushed; she could feel it. She struggled to keep her voice steady. "Maybe," she said. "But I 


wouldn't buy a scepter just yet if I were you, Caroline." She turned and went into the lunchroom. 
It was a relief to see Meredith and Bonnie, and Frances beside them. Elena felt her cheeks cool as she 
selected her lunch and went to join them. She wouldn't let Caroline upset her; she wouldn't think of 
Caroline at all. 


"I got it," said Frances, waving a piece of paper as Elena sat down. 
"And I have some good stuff," said Bonnie importantly. "Elena, listen to this. He's in my biology class, 
and I sit right across from him. And his name is Stefan, Stefan Salvatore, and he's from Italy, and he's 


boarding with old Mrs. Flowers on the edge of town." She sighed. "He is so romantic. Caroline dropped 
her books, and he picked them up for her." 
Elena made a wry face. "How clumsy of Caroline. What else happened?" 
"Well, that's all. He didn't really talk to her. He's ver-r-ry mysterious, you see. Mrs. Endicott, my biology 


teacher, tried to get him to take off his glasses, but he wouldn't. He has a medical condition." 
"What kind of medical condition?" 
"I don't know. Maybe it's terminal and his days are numbered. Wouldn't that be romantic?" 
"Oh, very," said Meredith. 
Elena was looking over Frances's sheet of paper, biting her lip. "He's in my seventh period, History of 


Europe. "Anybody else have that class?" 


"I do," said Bonnie. "And I think Caroline does, too. Oh, and maybe Matt; he said something yesterday 
about how it was just his luck, getting Mr. Tanner." 
Marvelous, Elena thought, picking up a fork and stabbing at her mashed potatoes. It looked as if seventh 

period was going to be extremely interesting. 

Stefan was glad the school day was almost over. He wanted to get out of these crowded rooms and 
corridors, just for a few minutes. 
So many minds. The pressure of so many thought patterns, so many mental voices surrounding him, was 

2 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
making him dizzy. It had been years since he had been in a swarm of people like this. 

One mind in particular stood out from the others. She had been among those watching him in the main 
corridor of the school building. He didn't know what she looked like, but her personality was powerful. 
He felt sure he'd recognize it again. 


So far, at least, he'd survived the first day of the masquerade. He'd used the Powers only twice, and then 
sparingly. But he was tired, and, he admitted ruefully, hungry. The rabbit hadn't been enough. 

So far, at least, he'd survived the first day of the masquerade. He'd used the Powers only twice, and then 
sparingly. But he was tired, and, he admitted ruefully, hungry. The rabbit hadn't been enough. 

It glowed at the edge of his consciousness, a golden light, soft and yet vibrant. And, for the first time, he 
could locate the girl it was coming from. She was seated right in front of him. 

Even as he thought it, she turned around and he saw her face. It was all he could do not to gasp in shock. 

Katherine! But of course it couldn't be. Katherine was dead; no one knew that better than he did. 

Still, the resemblance was uncanny. That pale golden hair, so fair it almost seemed to shimmer. That 
creamy skin, which had always made him think of swans, or alabaster, flushing faintly pink over the 
cheekbones. And the eyes... Katherine's eyes had been a color he had never seen before; darker than 
sky blue, as rich as the lapis lazuli in her jeweled headband. This girl had those same eyes. 

And they were fixed directly on his as she smiled. 

He looked down from the smile quickly. Of all things, he did not want to think about Katherine. He didn't 
want to look at this girl who reminded him of her, and he didn't want to feel her presence any longer. He 
kept his eyes on the desk, blocking his mind as strongly as he knew how. And at last, slowly, she turned 
around again. 

She was hurt. Even through the blocks, he could feel that. He didn't care. In fact, he was glad of it, and 
he hoped it would keep her away from him. Other than that, he had no feelings about her at all. 

He kept telling himself this as he sat, the droning voice of the teacher pouring over him unheard. But he 
could smell a subtle hint of some perfume-violets, he thought. And her slender white neck was bowed 
over her book, the fair hair falling on either side of it. 

In anger and frustration he recognized the seductive feeling in his teeth-more a tickling or a tingling than 
an ache. It was hunger, a specific hunger. And not one he was about to indulge. 

The teacher was pacing about the room like a ferret, asking questions, and Stefan deliberately fixed his 
attention on the man. At first he was puzzled, for although none of the students knew the answers, the 
questions kept coming. Then he realized that that was the man's purpose. To shame the students with 
what they didn't know. 

Just now he'd found another victim, a small girl with clusters of red curls and a heart-shaped face. Stefan 
watched in distaste as the teacher badgered her with questions. She looked wretched as he turned away 
from her to address the entire class.

"You see what I mean? You think you're pretty hot stuff; you're seniors now, ready to graduate. Well, let 
me tell you, some of you aren't ready to graduate kindergarten. Like this!" He gestured toward the 
red-haired girl. "No idea about the French Revolution. Thinks Marie Antoinette was a silent film star." 

Students all around Stefan were shifting uncomfortably. He could feel the resentment in their minds, and 
the humiliation. And the fear. They were all afraid of this thin little man with eyes like a weasel, even the 
husky boys who were taller than he was. 

"All right, let's try another era." The teacher swung back to the same girl he'd been questioning. "During 
the Renaissance-" He broke off. "You do know what the Renaissance is, don't you? The period 


between the thirteenth and seventeenth centuries, in which Europe rediscovered the great ideas of ancient 
Greece and Rome? The period that produced so many of Europe's greatest artists and thinkers?" When 
the girl nodded confusedly, he continued. "During the Renaissance, what would students your age be 
doing at school? Well? Any idea at all? Any guesses?"

doing at school? Well? Any idea at all? Any guesses?" 

At the ensuing laughter, the teacher's face darkened. "Hardly!" he snapped, and the classroom quieted. 
"You think this is a joke? Well, in those days, students your age would already be proficient in several 
languages. They would also have mastered logic, mathematics, astronomy, philosophy, and grammar. 
They would be ready to go on to a university, in which every course was taught in Latin. Football would 
be absolutely the last thing on-" 

"Excuse me." 

The quiet voice stopped the teacher in midharangue. Everyone turned to stare at Stefan. 

"What? What did you say?" 

"I said, excuse me," Stefan repeated, removing his glasses and standing up. "But you're wrong. Students 
in the Renaissance were encouraged to participate in games. They were taught that a healthy body goes 
with a healthy mind. And they certainly played team sports, like cricket, tennis-and even football." He 
turned to the red-haired girl and smiled, and she smiled back gratefully. To the teacher, he added, "But 
the most important things they learned were good manners and courtesy. I'm sure your book will tell you 
that." 

Students were grinning. The teacher's face was red with blood, and he was sputtering. But Stefan 
continued to hold his eyes, and after another minute it was the teacher who looked away. 

The bell rang. 

Stefan put his glasses on quickly and gathered his books. He'd already drawn more attention to himself 
than he should, and he didn't want to have to look at the blond girl again. Besides, he needed to get out 
of here quickly; there was a familiar burning sensation in his veins. 

As he reached the door, someone shouted, "Hey! Did they really play football back then?"

L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
He couldn't help throwing a grin over his shoulder. "Oh, yes. Sometimes with the severed heads of 
prisoners of war." 

Elena watched him as he went. He'd deliberately turned away from her. He'd snubbed her on purpose, 
and in front of Caroline, who'd been watching like a hawk. Tears burned in her eyes, but at that moment 
only one thought burned in her mind. 

She'd have him, even if it killed her. If it killed both of them, she'd have him. 

Chapter Three 

&laquo; ^ &raquo; 


The first light of dawn was streaking the night sky with pink and palest green. Stefan watched it from the 
window of his room in the boarding house. He had rented this room specifically because of the trapdoor 
in the ceiling, a trapdoor that opened onto the widow's walk on the roof above. Just now that door was 
open, and a cool damp wind blew down the ladder below it. Stefan was fully dressed, but not because 
he was up early. He had never been to sleep. 

The first light of dawn was streaking the night sky with pink and palest green. Stefan watched it from the 
window of his room in the boarding house. He had rented this room specifically because of the trapdoor

open, and a cool damp wind blew down the ladder below it. Stefan was fully dressed, but not because 
he was up early. He had never been to sleep. 

Why was he dwelling on these things? Of course, he should have realized that playing the role of a 
student was likely to bring his own student days back. Now the memories came thick and fast, as if he 
were skimming through the pages of a journal, his eyes catching an entry here and there. One flashed 
before him vividly now: his father's face when Damon had announced he was quitting the University. He 
would never forget that. He had never seen his father so angry... 

"What do you mean, you are not going back?" Giuseppe was usually a fair man, but he had a temper, 
and his elder son brought out the violence in him. 

Just now that son was dabbing at his lips with a saffron-colored silk handkerchief. "I would have thought 
even you could understand such a simple sentence, father. Shall I repeat it in Latin for you?" 

"Damon-" Stefan began tightly, appalled at this disrespect. But his father interrupted. 

"You are telling me that I, Giuseppe, Conte di Salvatore, will have to face my friends knowing that my 
son is a scioparto? A ne'er-do-well? An idler who makes no useful contribution to Florence?" Servants 
were edging away as Giuseppe worked himself into a rage. 

Damon did not even blink. "Apparently. If you can call those who fawn on you in the hopes that you will 
lend them money your friends." 

"Sporco parassito!" cried Giuseppe, rising from his chair. "Is it not bad enough that when you are at 
school you waste your time and my money? Oh, yes, I know all about the gambling, the jousting, the 
women. And I know that if it were not for your secretary and your tutors you would be failing every

L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
course. But now you mean to disgrace me utterly. And why? Why?" His large hand whipped up to grasp 
Damon's chin. "So that you may return to your hunting and hawking?" 


Stefan had to give his brother credit; Damon did not wince. He stood, almost lounging in his father's grip, 
every inch the aristocrat, from the elegantly plain cap on his dark head to his ermine-trimmed cloak to his 
soft leather shoes. His upper lip was curved in a line of pure arrogance. 


You've gone too far this time, thought Stefan, watching the two men whose eyes were locked together. 
Even you won't be able to charm your way out this time. 


But just then there was a light step in the study doorway. Turning, Stefan had been dazzled by eyes the 
color of lapis lazuli, framed with long golden lashes. It was Katherine. Her father, Baron von 


. 
Swartzschild, had brought her from the cold lands of the German princes to the Italian countryside, 
hoping it would help her recover from a prolonged illness. And since the day she had arrived, everything 
had changed for Stefan. 


Swartzschild, had brought her from the cold lands of the German princes to the Italian countryside, 
hoping it would help her recover from a prolonged illness. And since the day she had arrived, everything 
had changed for Stefan. 


"No, don't go. Stay," Stefan said quickly. He wanted to say more, to catch her hand-but he didn't dare. 
Not with his father here. All he could do was gaze into those jewellike blue eyes that were raised to his. 


"Yes, stay," Giuseppe said, and Stefan saw that his father's thunderous expression had lightened and that 
he had released Damon. He stepped forward, straightening the heavy folds of his long fur-trimmed gown. 
"Your father should be returning from his business in the city today, and he will be delighted to see you. 
But your cheeks are pale, little Katherine. You are not ill again, I hope?" 


"You know I am always pale, sir. I do not use rouge like your bold Italian girls." 


"You don't need it," said Stefan before he could stop himself, and Katherine smiled at him. She was so 
beautiful. An ache began in his chest. 


His father continued, "And I see all too little of you during the day. You seldom give us the pleasure of 
your company until twilight." 


"I have my studies and devotions in my own rooms, sir," said Katherine quietly, her lashes dropping. 
Stefan knew this was not true, but he said nothing; he would never betray Katherine's secret. She looked 
up at his father again. "But I am here now, sir." 


"Yes, yes, that is true. And I must see that tonight we have a very special meal for your father's return. 
Damon... we will speak later." As Giuseppe motioned to a servant and strode out, Stefan turned to 
Katherine in delight. It was seldom they could speak to each other without the presence of his father or 
of Gudren, her stolid German maid. 


But what Stefan saw then was like a blow to his stomach. Katherine was smiling-the little secret smile 
that she had often shared with him. 


But she was not looking at him. She was looking at Damon. 


6 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
Stefan hated his brother at that moment, hated Damon's dark beauty and grace and the sensuality that 
drew women to him like moths to a flame. He wanted, in that instant, to strike Damon, to smash that 
beauty to pieces. Instead he had to stand and watch as Katherine moved slowly toward his brother, step 
by step, her golden brocade gown whispering on the tiled floor. 


And even as he watched, Damon held out a hand to Katherine, and smiled the cruel smile of triumph... 


Stefan turned away from the window sharply. 


Why was he reopening old wounds? But, even as he thought it, he drew out the slender gold chain he 
wore under his shirt. His thumb and forefinger caressed the ring that hung from it, then he held it up to the 
light. 


The little circlet was exquisitely worked in gold, and five centuries had not dimmed its luster. It was set 
with one stone, a lapis the size of his little fingernail. Stefan looked at it, then at the heavy silver ring, also 


. 
set with lapis, on his own hand. In his chest was a familiar tightness. 


set with lapis, on his own hand. In his chest was a familiar tightness. 


Stefan leaned against the window, his forehead pressed to its coolness. His tutor had had another saying: 
Evil will never find peace. It may triumph, but it will never find peace. 


Why had he even come to Fell's Church? 


He had hoped to find peace here, but that was impossible. He would never be accepted, he would never 
rest. Because he was evil. He could not change what he was. 


Elena was up even earlier than usual that morning. She could hear Aunt Judith pottering about in her 
room, getting ready for her shower. Margaret was still fast asleep, curled up like a little mouse in her bed. 
Elena passed her younger sister's half-open door noiselessly and continued down the hallway to let 
herself out of the house. 


The air was fresh and clear this morning; the quince tree was inhabited only by the usual jays and 
sparrows. Elena, who had gone to bed with a throbbing headache, lifted her face to the clean blue sky 
and breathed deeply. 


She felt much better than she had yesterday. She'd promised to meet Matt before school, and though she 
wasn't looking forward to it she was sure it was going to be all right. 


Matt lived only two streets away from the high school. It was a simple frame house, like all the others on 
that street, except that maybe the swing on the porch was a little shabbier, the paint a little more peeled. 
Matt was already standing outside, and for a moment her heart picked up at the sight of him as it used to. 


He was good-looking. There was no doubt about that. Not in the stunning, almost disturbing way that-
that some people were, but in a healthy American way. Matt Honeycutt was all-American. His blond hair 
was cropped short for the football season, and his skin was sunburnt from working outdoors on his 
grandparents' farm. His blue eyes were honest and straightforward. And just today, as he held out his 
arms to hug her gently, they were a little sad.

L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
"You want to come inside?" 


"No. Let's just walk," Elena said. They went side by side without touching. Maples and black walnut 
trees lined this street, and the air still had a morning hush. Elena watched her feet on the wet sidewalk, 
feeling suddenly uncertain. She didn't know how to start after all. 


"So you still haven't told me about France," he said. 


"Oh, it was great," said Elena. She glanced sideways at him. He was looking at the sidewalk, too. 
"Everything about it was great," she continued, trying to put some enthusiasm in her voice. "The people, 
the food, everything. It was really..." Her voice trailed off, and she laughed nervously. 


"Yeah, I know. Great," he finished for her. He stopped and stood looking down at his scuffed tennis 
shoes. Elena recognized them from last year. Matt's family barely got by; maybe he hadn't been able to 
afford new shoes. She looked up to find those steady blue eyes on her face. 


. 
"You know, you look pretty great right now," he said. 


"You know, you look pretty great right now," he said. 


"And I guess you have something to tell me." She stared at him, and he smiled, a crooked, rueful smile. 
Then he held out his arms again. 


"Oh, Matt," she said, hugging him hard. She stepped back to look into his face. "Matt, you are the nicest 
guy I've ever met. I don't deserve you." 


"Oh, so that's why you're dumping me," said Matt as they started walking again. "Because I'm too good 
for you. I should have realized that before." 


She punched him in the arm. "No, that isn't why, and I am not dumping you. We're going to be friends, 
right?" 


"Oh, sure. Oh, absolutely." 


"Because that's what I've realized we are." She stopped, looking up at him again. "Good friends. Be 
honest, now, Matt, isn't that how you really feel about me?" 


He looked at her, then rolled his eyes heavenward. "Can I take the Fifth on that?" he said. As Elena's 
face fell, he added, "It doesn't have anything to do with that new guy, does it?" 


"No," Elena said after a hesitation, and then added quickly, "I haven't even met him yet. I don't know 
him." 


"But you want to. No, don't say it." He put an arm around her and gently turned her. "Come on, let's 
head toward school. If we have time, I'll even buy you a doughnut." 


As they walked, something thrashed in the walnut tree above them. Matt whistled and pointed. "Look at 
that! Biggest crow I've ever seen."

L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
Elena looked, but it was already gone. 

School that day was merely a convenient place for Elena to review her plan. 

She had woken up this morning knowing what to do. And today she gathered as much information as she 
could on the subject of Stefan Salvatore. Which wasn't hard, because everyone at Robert E. Lee was 
talking about him. 


It was common knowledge that he'd had some sort of run-in with the admissions secretary yesterday. 
And today he'd been called to the principal's office. Something about his papers. But the principal had 
sent him back to class (after, it was rumored, a long-distance call to Rome-or was it Washington?), and 
everything seemed to be settled now. Officially, at least. 


When Elena arrived for Euro History class that afternoon, she was greeted by a low whistle in the hall. 
Dick Carter and Tyler Smallwood were loitering there. A couple of prize jerks, she thought, ignoring the 
whistle and their staring. They thought being tackle and safety on the varsity football team made them hot 
stuff. She kept an eye on them as she loitered in the corridor herself, refreshing her lipstick and fiddling 
with her compact. She'd given Bonnie her special instructions, and the plan was ready to be put into 
effect as soon as Stefan showed up. The compact mirror gave her a wonderful view of the hall behind 


. 
her. 
Still, she missed him coming somehow. He was beside her suddenly, and she snapped the compact shut 
as he passed. She meant to stop him, but something happened before she could. Stefan tensed-or, at 


least, there was something about him that seemed wary all at once. Just then Dick and Tyler stepped in 
front of the door to the history classroom. Blocking the way. 
World-class jerks, thought Elena. Fuming, she glared at them over Stefan's shoulder. 
They were enjoying the game, slouching in the doorway, pretending they were completely blind to Stefan 


standing there. 
"Excuse me." It was the same tone he'd used with the history teacher. Quiet, detached. 
Dick and Tyler looked at each other, then all around, as if hearing spirit voices. 
"Scoozi?" Tyler said in a falsetto. "Scoozi me? Me scoozi? Jacuzzi?" They both laughed. 
Elena watched muscles tighten under the T-shirt in front of her. This was completely unfair; they were 


both taller than Stefan, and Tyler was about twice as broad. 


"Is there a problem here?" Elena was as startled as the boys were at the new voice behind her. She 
turned to see Matt. His blue eyes were hard. 
Elena bit her lips on a smile as Tyler and Dick moved slowly, resentfully out of the way. Good old Matt, 


she thought. But now good old Matt was walking into class beside Stefan, and she was left following 
them, staring at the backs of two T-shirts. When they sat down, she slid into the desk behind Stefan, 
where she could watch him without being watched herself. Her plan would have to wait until after class.

L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
Matt was rattling change in his pocket, which meant he wanted to say something. 
"Uh, hey," he began at last, uncomfortably. "Those guys, you know..." 
Stefan laughed. It was a bitter sound. "Who am I to judge?" There was more emotion in his voice than 


Elena had heard before, even when he had spoken to Mr. Tanner. And that emotion was raw 
unhappiness. "Anyway, why should I be welcome here?" he finished, almost to himself. 


"Why shouldn't you be?" Matt had been staring at Stefan; now his jaw squared with decision. 
"Listen," he said. "You were talking about football yesterday. Well, our star wide receiver tore a ligament 
yesterday afternoon, and we need a replacement. Tryouts are this afternoon. What do you think?" 


"Me?" Stefan sounded caught off guard. "Ah... I don't know if I could." 
"Can you run?" 
"Can-?" Stefan half turned toward Matt, and Elena could see a faint hint of a smile curve his lips. "Yes." 
"Can you catch?" 
"Yes." 
"That's all a wide receiver has to do. I'm the quarterback. If you can catch what I throw and run with it, 


you can play." 


. 
"I see." Stefan was actually almost smiling, and though Matt's mouth was serious his blue eyes were 
dancing. Astonished at herself, Elena realized she was jealous. There was a warmth between the two 
boys that shut her out completely.

At that moment, Bonnie and Caroline arrived and class started. 


Throughout Tanner's lecture on Europe, 


Elena repeated to herself, "Hello. I'm Elena Gilbert. I'm on the Senior Welcoming Committee, and I've 
been assigned to show you around the school. Now, you wouldn't want to get me in trouble, would you, 
by not letting me do my job?" That last with wide, wistful eyes-but only if he looked like he might try to 
get out of it. It was virtually foolproof. He was a sucker for maidens who needed to be rescued. 


Halfway through class, the girl sitting to her right passed her a note. Elena opened it and recognized 
Bonnie's round, childish handwriting. It read: "I kept C. away for as long as I could. What happened? 
Did it work???" 


Elena looked up to see Bonnie twisted around in her front-row seat. Elena pointed to the note and shook 
her head, mouthing, "After class." 


It seemed a century until Tanner gave some last-minute instructions about oral reports and dismissed 


Page 20 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
them. Then everybody sprang up at once. Here goes, thought Elena, and, with her heart pounding, she 
stepped squarely into Stefan's path, blocking the aisle so that he couldn't get around her. 

Just like Dick and Tyler, she thought, feeling a hysterical urge to giggle. She looked up and found her 
eyes exactly on a level with his mouth. 

Her mind went blank. What was it she was supposed to say? She opened her mouth, and somehow the 
words she'd been practicing came tumbling out. "Hi, I'm Elena Gilbert, and I'm on the Senior Welcoming 
Committee and I've been assigned-" 

"I'm sorry; I don't have time." For a minute, she couldn't believe he was speaking, that he wasn't even 
going to give her a chance to finish. Her mouth went right on with the speech. 

"-to show you around the school-" 

"I'm sorry; I can't. I have to-to get to football tryouts." Stefan turned to Matt, who was standing by 
looking amazed. "You said they were right after school, didn't you?" 

"Yes," Matt said slowly. "But-" 

"Then I'd better get moving. Maybe you could show me the way." 

Matt looked helplessly at Elena, then shrugged. "Well... sure. Come on." He glanced back once as they 
left. Stefan didn't. 

Elena found herself looking around at a circle of interested observers, including Caroline, who was 
openly smirking. Elena felt a numbness in her body and a fullness in her throat. She couldn't stand to be 
here for one more second. She turned and walked as quickly as she could from the room. 


Chapter Four

By the time Elena reached her locker, the numbness was wearing off and the lump in her throat was 
trying to dissolve into tears. But she wouldn't cry at school, she told herself, she wouldn't. After closing 
her locker, she made for the main exit. 

For the second day in a row, she was coming home from school right after the last bell, and alone. Aunt 
Judith wouldn't be able to cope. But when Elena reached her house, Aunt Judith's car was not in the 
driveway; she and Margaret must have gone out to the market. The house was still and peaceful as Elena 
let herself in. 

She was glad for that stillness; she wanted to be alone right now. But, on the other hand, she didn't 
exactly know what to do with herself. 

Now that she finally could cry, she found that tears wouldn't come. She let her backpack sag to the floor 
in the front hall and walked slowly into the living room. 

It was a handsome, impressive room, the only part of the house besides Elena's bedroom that belonged 

Page 21 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
to the original structure. That first house had been built before 1861, and had been almost completely 
burned in the Civil War. All that could be saved was this room, with its elaborate fireplace framed by 
scrolled molding, and the big bedroom above. Elena's father's greatgrandfather had built a new house, 
and Gilberts had lived in it ever since. 

Elena turned to look out of one of the ceiling-to-floor windows. The glass was so old that it was thick 
and wavery, and everything outside was distorted, looking slightly tipsy. She remembered the first time 
her father had showed her that wavery old glass, when she had been younger than Margaret was now. 

The fullness in her throat was back, but still no tears would come. Everything inside her was 
contradictory. She didn't want company, and yet she was achingly lonely. She did want to think, but now 
that she was trying to, her thoughts eluded her like mice running from a white owl. 

White owl... hunting bird... flesh eater... crow, she thought. "Biggest crow I've ever seen," Matt had 
said. 

Her eyes stung again. Poor Matt. She'd hurt him, but he'd been so nice about it. He'd even been nice to 
Stefan. 

Stefan. Her heart thudded once, hard, squeezing two hot tears out of her eyes. There, she was crying at 
last. She was crying with anger and humiliation and frustration-and what else? 

What had she really lost today? What did she really feel for this stranger, this Stefan Salvatore? He was a 
challenge, yes, and that made him different, interesting. Stefan was exotic... exciting. 

Funny, that was what guys had sometimes told Elena she was. And later she heard from them, or from 
their friends or sisters, how nervous they were before going out with her, how their palms got sweaty and 
their stomachs were full of butterflies. Elena had always found such stories amusing. No boy she'd ever 
met in her life had made her nervous. 

But when she'd spoken to Stefan today, her pulse had been racing, her knees weak. Her palms had been 
wet. And there hadn't been butterflies in her stomach-there had been bats. 


She was interested in the guy because he made her feel nervous? Not a very good reason, Elena, she 
told herself. In fact, a very bad reason. 

She was interested in the guy because he made her feel nervous? Not a very good reason, Elena, she 
told herself. In fact, a very bad reason. 

"Elena!" 

Elena jumped, her reverie shattered. But it wasn't Stefan Salvatore calling her, it was Aunt Judith rattling 
the front door open. 

"Elena? Elena!" And that was Margaret, her voice shrill and piping. "Are you home?" 

Misery welled up in Elena again, and she glanced around the kitchen. She couldn't face her aunt's 
worried questions or Margaret's innocent cheerfulness right now. Not with her eyelashes wet and new 
tears threatening any minute. She made a lightning decision and quietly slipped out the back door as the 
front door banged shut. 

Page 22 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
Once off the back porch and into the yard, she hesitated. She didn't want to run into anyone she knew. 
But where could she go to be alone? 

The answer came almost instantly. Of course. She'd go see Mom and Dad. 

It was a fairly long walk, almost to the edge of town, but over the last three years it had become familiar 
to Elena. She crossed over Wickery Bridge and climbed up the hill, past the ruined church, then down 
into the little valley below. 

This part of the cemetery was well-kept; it was the old section that was allowed to run slightly wild. 
Here, the grass was neatly trimmed, and bouquets of flowers made splashes of bright color. Elena sat 
down by the big marble headstone with "Gilbert" carved into the front. 

"Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad," she whispered. She leaned over to place a purple impatiens blossom she'd picked 
along the way in front of the marker. Then she curled her legs under her and just sat. 

She'd come here often after the accident. Margaret had been only one at the time of the car crash; she 
didn't really remember them. But Elena did. Now she let her mind leaf back through memories, and the 
lump in her throat swelled, and the tears came easier. She missed them so much, still. Mother, so young 
and beautiful, and Father, with a smile that crinkled up his eyes. 

She was lucky to have Aunt Judith, of course. It wasn't every aunt who would quit her job and move 
back into a little town to take care of two orphaned nieces. And Robert, Aunt Judith's fianc.., was more 
like a stepfather to Margaret than an uncle-to-be by marriage. 

But Elena remembered her parents. Sometimes, right after the funeral, she had come out here to rage at 
them, angry with them for being so stupid as to get themselves killed. That was when she hadn't known 
Aunt Judith very well, and had felt there was nowhere on earth she belonged anymore. 

Where did she belong now? she wondered. The easy answer was, here, in Fell's Church, where she'd 
lived all her life. But lately the easy answer seemed wrong. Lately she felt there must be something else 
out there for her, some place she would recognize at once and call home. 


A shadow fell over her, and she looked up, startled. For an instant, the two figures standing over her 
were alien, unfamiliar, vaguely menacing. She stared, frozen. 

A shadow fell over her, and she looked up, startled. For an instant, the two figures standing over her 
were alien, unfamiliar, vaguely menacing. She stared, frozen. 

Elena blinked and then laughed shortly. It was Bonnie and Meredith. "What does a person have to do to 
get a little privacy around here?" she said as they sat down. 

"Tell us to go away," suggested Meredith, but Elena just shrugged. Meredith and Bonnie had often come 
out here to find her in the months after the accident. Suddenly, she felt glad about that, and grateful to 
them both. If nowhere else, she belonged with the friends who cared about her. She didn't mind if they 
knew she had been crying, and she accepted the crumpled tissue Bonnie offered her and wiped her eyes. 
The three of them sat together in silence for a little while, watching the wind ruffle the stand of oak trees 
at the edge of the cemetery.

"I'm sorry about what happened," Bonnie said at last, in a soft voice. "That was really terrible." 

"And your middle name is 'Tact,' " said Meredith. "It couldn't have been that bad, Elena." 

"You weren't there." Elena felt herself go hot all over again at the memory. "It was terrible. But I don't 
care anymore," she added flatly, defiantly. "I'm finished with him. I don't want him anyway." 


"Elena!" 


"I don't, Bonnie. He obviously thinks he's too good for-for Americans. So he can just take those 
designer sunglasses and..." 


There were snorts of laughter from the other girls. Elena wiped her nose and shook her head. "So," she 
said to Bonnie, determinedly changing the subject, "at least Tanner seemed in a better mood today." 


Bonnie looked martyred. "Do you know that he made me sign up to be the very first one to give my oral 
report? I don't care, though; I'm going to do mine on the druids, and-" 


"On the what?" 


"Droo-ids. The weird old guys who built Stonehenge and did magic and stuff in ancient England. I'm 
descended from them, and that's why I'm psychic." 


Meredith snorted, but Elena frowned at the blade of grass she was twirling between her fingers. "Bonnie, 
did you really see something yesterday in my palm?" she asked abruptly. 


Bonnie hesitated. "I don't know," she said at last. "I-I thought I did then. But sometimes my 
imagination runs away with me." 


"She knew you were here," said Meredith unexpectedly. "I thought of looking at the coffee shop, but 
Bonnie said, 'She's at the cemetery.' " 


"Did I?" Bonnie looked faintly surprised but impressed. "Well, there you see. My grandmother in 
Edinburgh has the second sight and so do I. It always skips a generation." 


"And you're descended from the druids," Meredith said solemnly. 


"Well, it's true! In Scotland they keep up the old traditions. You wouldn't believe some of the things my 
grandmother does. She has a way to find out who you're going to marry and when you're going to die. 
She told me I'm going to die early." 


. 
"Bonnie!" 
"She did. I'm going to be young and beautiful in my coffin. Don't you think that's romantic?" 
"No, I don't. I think it's disgusting," said Elena. The shadows were getting longer, and the wind had a chill 


to it now. 
"So who are you going to marry, Bonnie?" Meredith put in deftly. 
"I don't know. My grandmother told me the ritual for finding out, but I never tried it. Of course"-Bonnie 


Page 24 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
struck a sophisticated pose-"he has to be outrageously rich and totally gorgeous. Like our mysterious 

dark stranger, for example. Particularly if nobody else wants him." She cast a wicked glance at Elena. 
Elena refused the bait. "What about Tyler Smallwood?" she murmured innocently. "His father's certainly 
rich enough." 

"And he's not bad-looking," agreed Meredith solemnly. "That is, of course, if you're an animal lover. All 

those big white teeth." 
The girls looked at each other and then simultaneously burst into laughter. Bonnie threw a handful of 
grass at Meredith, who brushed it off and threw a dandelion back at her. Somewhere in the middle of it, 
Elena realized that she was going to be all right. She was herself again, not lost, not a stranger, but Elena 
Gilbert, the queen of Robert E. Lee. She pulled the apricot ribbon out of her hair and shook the hair free 
about her face. 


"I've decided what to do my oral report on," she said, watching with narrow eyes as Bonnie 
finger-combed grass out of her curls. 


"What?" said Meredith. 
Elena tilted her chin up to gaze at the red and purple sky above the hill. She took a thoughtful breath and 
let the suspense build for a moment. Then she said coolly, "The Italian Renaissance." 


Bonnie and Meredith stared at her, then looked at each other and burst into whoops of laughter again. 
"Aha," said Meredith when they recovered. "So the tiger returneth." 
Elena gave her a feral grin. Her shaken confidence had returned to her. And though she didn't understand 


it herself, she knew one thing: she wasn't going to let Stefan Salvatore get away alive. 
"All right," she said briskly. "Now, listen, you two. Nobody else can know about this, or I'll be the 
laughingstock of the school. And Caroline would just love any excuse to make me look ridiculous. But I 


do still want him, and I'm going to have him. I don't know how yet, but I am. Until I come up with a plan, 
though, we're going to give him the cold shoulder." 
"Oh, we are?" 
"Yes, we are. You can't have him, Bonnie; he's mine. And I have to be able to trust you completely." 
"Wait a minute," said Meredith, a glint in her eye. She unclasped the cloisonne pin from her blouse, then, 


holding up her thumb, made a quick jab. "Bonnie, give me your hand." 
"Why?" said Bonnie, eyeing the pin suspiciously. 
"Because I want to marry you. Why do you think, idiot?" 


Page 25 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
. 
"But-but-Oh, all right. Ow!" 


"But-but-Oh, all right. Ow!" 


"Look, swearing with blood is dangerous," Bonnie protested seriously. "It means you have to stick to 
your oath no matter what happens, no matter what, Meredith." 


"I know," said Meredith grimly. "That's why I'm telling you to do it. I remember what happened with 
Michael Martin." 


Bonnie made a face. "That was years ago, and we broke up right away anyway and-Oh, all right. I'll 
swear." Closing her eyes, she said, "I swear to keep this a secret and to do anything Elena asks about 
Stefan." 


Meredith repeated the oath. And Elena, staring at the pale shadows of their thumbs joined together in the 
gathering dusk, took a long breath and said softly, "And I swear not to rest until he belongs to me." 


A gust of cold wind blew through the cemetery, fanning the girls' hair out and sending dry leaves fluttering 
on the ground. Bonnie gasped and pulled back, and they all looked around, then giggled nervously. 


"It's dark," said Elena, surprised. 


"We'd better get started home," Meredith said, refastening her pin as she stood up. Bonnie stood, too, 
putting the tip of her thumb into her mouth. 


"Good-bye," said Elena softly, facing the headstone. The purple blossom was a blur on the ground. She 
picked up the apricot ribbon that lay next to it, turned, and nodded to Bonnie and Meredith. "Let's go." 


Silently, they headed up the hill toward the ruined church. The oath sworn in blood had given them all a 
solemn feeling, and as they passed the ruined church Bonnie shivered. With the sun down, the 
temperature had dropped abruptly, and the wind was rising. Each gust sent whispers through the grass 
and made the ancient oak trees rattle their dangling leaves. 


"I'm freezing," Elena said, pausing for a moment by the black hole that had once been the church door 
and looking down at the landscape below. 


The moon had not yet risen, and she could just make out the old graveyard and Wickery Bridge beyond 
it. The old graveyard dated from Civil War days, and many of the headstones bore the names of soldiers. 
It had a wild look to it; brambles and tall weeds grew on the graves, and ivy vines swarmed over 
crumbling granite. Elena had never liked it. 


"It looks different, doesn't it? In the dark, I mean," she said unsteadily. She didn't know how to say what 
she really meant, that it was not a place for the living. 


"We could go the long way," said Meredith. "But that would mean another twenty minutes of walking." 


"I don't mind going this way," said Bonnie, swallowing hard. "I always said I wanted to be buried down 
there in the old one." 


"Will you stop talking about being buried!" Elena snapped, and she started down the hill. But the farther 


Page 26 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
down the narrow path she got, the more uncomfortable she felt. She slowed until Bonnie and Meredith 


caught up with her. As they neared the first headstone, her heart began beating fast. She tried to ignore it, 
but her whole skin was tingling with awareness and the fine hairs on her arms were standing up. Between 
the gusts of wind, every sound seemed horribly magnified; the crunching of their feet on the leaf-strewn 
path was deafening. 

caught up with her. As they neared the first headstone, her heart began beating fast. She tried to ignore it, 
but her whole skin was tingling with awareness and the fine hairs on her arms were standing up. Between 
the gusts of wind, every sound seemed horribly magnified; the crunching of their feet on the leaf-strewn 
path was deafening. 

"Why are we stopping?" said Meredith. 

"I just... I'm sorry," Elena murmured, but when she forced herself to turn she immediately stiffened. 
"Bonnie?" she said. "Bonnie, what's wrong?" 

Bonnie was staring straight out into the graveyard, her lips parted, her eyes as wide and blank as the 
stone cherub's. Fear washed through Elena's stomach. "Bonnie, stop it. Stop it! It's not funny." 

Bonnie made no reply. 

"Bonnie!" said Meredith. She and Elena looked at each other, and suddenly Elena knew she had to get 
away. She whirled to start down the path, but a strange voice spoke behind her, and she jerked around. 

"Elena," the voice said. It wasn't Bonnie's voice, but it came from Bonnie's mouth. Pale in the darkness, 
Bonnie was still staring out into the graveyard. There was no expression on her face at all. 

"Elena," the voice said again, and added, as Bonnie's head turned toward her, "there's someone waiting 
out there for you." 

Elena never quite knew what happened in the next few minutes. Something seemed to move out among 
the dark humped shapes of the headstones, shifting and rising between them. Elena screamed and 
Meredith cried out, and then they were both running, and Bonnie was running with them, screaming, too. 

Elena pounded down the narrow path, stumbling on rocks and clumps of grass root. Bonnie was sobbing 
for breath behind her, and Meredith, calm and cynical Meredith, was panting wildly. There was a sudden 
thrashing and a shriek in an oak tree above them, and Elena found that she could run faster. 

"There's something behind us," cried Bonnie shrilly. "Oh, God, what's happening?" 

"Get to the bridge," gasped Elena through the fire in her lungs. She didn't know why, but she felt they had 
to make it there. "Don't stop, Bonnie! Don't look behind you!" She grabbed the other girl's sleeve and 
pulled her around. 

"I can't make it," Bonnie sobbed, clutching her side, her pace faltering. 

"Yes, you can," snarled Elena, grabbing Bonnie's sleeve again and forcing her to keep moving. "Come 
on. Come on!" 

Page 27 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
She saw the silver gleam of water before them. And there was the clearing between the oak trees, and 
the bridge just beyond. Elena's legs were wobbling and her breath was whistling in her throat, but she 
wouldn't let herself lag behind. Now she could see the wooden planks of the footbridge. The bridge was 
twenty feet away from them, ten feet away, five. 


. 
"We made it," panted Meredith, feet thundering on the wood. 


"We made it," panted Meredith, feet thundering on the wood. 


The bridge creaked as they ran staggering across it, their steps echoing across the water. When she 
jumped onto packed dirt on the far shore, Elena let go of Bonnie's sleeve at last, and allowed her legs to 
stumble to a halt. 


Meredith was bent over, hands on thighs, deep-breathing. Bonnie was crying. 


"What was it? Oh, what was it?" she said. "Is it still coming?" 


"I thought you were the expert," Meredith said unsteadily. "For God's sake, Elena, let's get out of here." 


"No, it's all right now," Elena whispered. There were tears in her own eyes and she was shaking all over, 
but the hot breath at the back of her neck had gone. The river stretched between her and it, the waters a 
dark tumult. "It can't follow us here," she said. 


Meredith stared at her, then at the other shore with its clustered oak trees, then at Bonnie. She wet her 
lips and laughed shortly. "Sure. It can't follow us. But let's go home anyway, all right? Unless you feel like 
spending the night out here." 


Some unnameable feeling shuddered through Elena. "Not tonight, thanks," she said. She put an arm 
around Bonnie, who was still sniffling. "It's okay, Bonnie. We're safe now. Come on." 


Meredith was looking across the river again. "You know, I don't see a thing back there," she said, her 
voice calmer. "Maybe there wasn't anything behind us at all; maybe we just panicked and scared 
ourselves. With a little help from the druid priestess here." 


Elena said nothing as they started walking, keeping very close together on the dirt path. But she 
wondered. She wondered very much. 


Chapter Five 


&laquo; ^ &raquo; 


The full moon was directly overhead when Stefan came back to the boarding house. He was giddy, 
almost reeling, both from fatigue and from the glut of blood he'd taken. It had been a long time since he'd 
let himself feed so heavily. But the burst of wild Power by the graveyard had caught him up in its frenzy, 
shattering his already weakened control. He still wasn't sure where the Power had come from. He had 
been watching the human girls from his place in the shadows when it had exploded from behind him, 
sending the girls fleeing. He had been caught between the fear that they would run into the river and the 
desire to probe this Power and find its source. In the end, he had followed her, unable to chance her 
getting hurt. 


Page 28 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
Something black had winged toward the woods as the humans reached the sanctuary of the bridge, but 
even Stefan's night senses could not make out what it was. He had watched while she and the other two 
started in the direction of town. Then he had turned back to the graveyard. 

It was empty now, purged of whatever had been there. On the ground lay a thin strip of silk that to 


ordinary eyes would have been gray in the dark. But he saw its true color, and as he crushed it between 
his fingers, bringing it slowly up to touch his lips, he could smell the scent of her hair. 

ordinary eyes would have been gray in the dark. But he saw its true color, and as he crushed it between 
his fingers, bringing it slowly up to touch his lips, he could smell the scent of her hair. 

He had heard every soft breath she took, felt her warmth radiating against his back, sensed each throb of 
her sweet pulse. And eventually, to his horror, he had found himself giving in to it. His tongue had 
brushed back and forth over his canine teeth, enjoying the pleasure-pain that was building there, 
encouraging it. He'd breathed her smell into his nostrils deliberately, and let the visions come to him, 
imagining it all. How soft her neck would be, and how his lips would meet it with equal softness at first, 
planting tiny kisses here, and here, until he reached the yielding hollow of her throat. How he would 
nuzzle there, in the place where her heart beat so strongly against the delicate skin. And how at last his 
lips would part, would draw back from aching teeth now sharp as little daggers, and-

No. He'd brought himself out of the trance with a jerk, his own pulse beating raggedly, his body shaking. 
The class had been dismissed, movement was all around him, and he could only hope no one had been 
observing him too closely. 

When she had spoken to him, he had been unable to believe that he had to face her while his veins 
burned and his whole upper jaw ached. He'd been afraid for a moment that his control would break, that 
he would seize her shoulders and take her in front of all of them. He had no idea how he'd gotten away, 
only that some time later he was channeling his energy into hard exercise, dimly aware that he must not 
use the Powers. It didn't matter; even without them he was in every way superior to the mortal boys who 
competed with him on the football field. 

His sight was sharper, his reflexes faster, his muscles stronger. Presently a hand had clapped him on the 
back and Matt's voice had rung in his ears: 

"Congratulations! Welcome to the team!" 

Looking into that honest, smiling face, Stefan had been overcome with shame. If you knew what I was, 
you wouldn't smile at me, he'd thought grimly. I've won this competition of yours by deception. And the 
girl you love-you do love her, don't you?-is in my thoughts right now. 

And she had remained in his thoughts despite all his efforts to banish her that afternoon. He had 
wandered to the graveyard blindly, pulled from the woods by a force he did not understand. Once there 
he had watched her, fighting himself, fighting the need, until the surge of Power had sent her and her 
friends running. And then he'd come home-but only after feeding. After losing control of himself. 

He couldn't remember exactly how it had happened, how he'd let it happen. That flare of Power had 
started it, awakening things inside him best left sleeping. The hunting need. The craving for the chase, for 
the smell of fear and the savage triumph of the kill. It had been years-centuries-since he'd felt the need 
with such force. His veins had begun burning like fire. And all his thoughts had turned red: he could think 

Page 29 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
of nothing else but the hot coppery taste, the primal vibrancy, of blood. 
With that excitement still raging through him, he'd taken a step or two after the girls. What might have 


happened if he hadn't scented the old man was better not thought about. But as he reached the end of the 
bridge, his nostrils had flared at the sharp, distinctive odor of human flesh. 
Human blood. The ultimate elixir, the forbidden wine. More intoxicating than any liquor, the steaming

essence of life itself. And he was so tired of fighting the need. 
essence of life itself. And he was so tired of fighting the need. 
And then there was no sound but the feeding. 
Now, as he stumbled up the main staircase of the boarding house, he tried not to think about it, and not 


to think about her-about the girl who tempted him with her warmth, her life. She had been the one he 
truly desired, but he must put a stop to that, he must kill any such thoughts before they were started from 
now on. For his sake, and for her own. He was her worst nightmare come true, and she didn't even 
know it. 

"Who's there? Is that you, boy?" a cracked voice called sharply. One of the second-story doors opened, 
and a gray head poked out. 
"Yes, signora-Mrs. Flowers. I'm sorry if I disturbed you." 
"Ah, it takes more than a creaky floorboard to disturb me. You locked the door behind you?" 


"Yes, signora. You're... safe." 
"That's right. We need to be safe here. You never know what might be out there in those woods, do 
you?" He looked quickly at the smiling little face surrounded by wisps of gray hair, the bright darting 
eyes. Was there a secret hidden in them? 


"Good night, signora." 
"Good night, boy." She shut the door. 
In his own room he fell onto the bed and lay staring up at the low, slanting ceiling. 
Usually he rested uneasily at night; it was not his natural sleeping time. But tonight he was tired. It took so 


much energy to face the sunlight, and the heavy meal only contributed to his lethargy. Soon, although his 


eyes did not close, he no longer saw the whitewashed ceiling above him. 
Random scraps of memory floated through his mind. Katherine, so lovely that evening by the fountain, 
moonlight silvering her pale golden hair. How proud he had been to sit with her, to be the one to share 
her secret... 


"But can you never go out in sunlight?" 
"I can, yes, as long as I wear this." She held up a small white hand, and the moonlight shone on the lapis 


Page 30 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
ring there. "But the sun tires me so much. I have never been very strong." 

Stefan looked at her, at the delicacy of her features and the slightness of her body. She was almost as 
insubstantial as spun glass. No, she would never have been strong. 

"I was often ill as a child," she said softly, her eyes on the play of water in the fountain. "The last time, the 
surgeon finally said I would die. I remember Papa crying, and I remember lying in my big bed, too weak 
to move. Even breathing was too much effort. I was so sad to leave the world and so cold, so very cold." 
She shivered, and then smiled. 

"But what happened?" 


"I woke in the middle of the night to see Gudren, my maid, standing over my bed. And then she stepped 
aside, and I saw the man she had brought. I was frightened. His name was Klaus, and I'd heard the 
people in the village say he was evil. I cried out to Gudren to save me, but she just stood there, watching. 
When he put his mouth to my neck, I thought he was going to kill me."

"And you never will?" 

"No. That is the wonder of it, Stefan!" She gazed up at him with childlike joy. "I will be young forever, 
and I will never die! Can you imagine?" 

He could not imagine her as anything other than what she was now: lovely, innocent, perfect. "But-you 
did not find it frightening at first?" 

"At first, a little. But Gudren showed me what to do. It was she who told me to have this ring made, with 
a gem that would protect me from sunlight. While I lay in bed, she brought me rich warm possets to 
drink. Later, she brought small animals her son trapped." 

"Not... people?" 

Her laughter rang out. "Of course not. I can get all I need in a night from a dove. Gudren says that if I 
wish to be powerful I should take human blood, for the life essence of humans is strongest. And Klaus 
used to urge me, too; he wanted to exchange blood again. But I tell Gudren I do not want power. And as 
for Klaus..." She stopped and dropped her eyes, so that heavy lashes lay on her cheek. Her voice was 
very soft as she continued. "I do not think it is a thing to be done lightly. I will take human blood only 
when I have found my companion, the one who will be by my side for all eternity." She looked up at him 
gravely. 

Stefan smiled at her, feeling light-headed and bursting with pride. He could scarcely contain the happiness 
he felt at that moment. 

But that was before his brother Damon had returned from the University. Before Damon had come back 
and seen Katherine's jewel-blue eyes. 

Page 31 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
On his bed in the low-roofed room, Stefan moaned. Then the darkness drew him in deeper and new 
images began to flicker through his mind. 

They were scattered glimpses of the past that did not form a connected sequence. He saw them like 
scenes briefly illuminated by flashes of lightning. His brother's face, twisted into a mask of inhuman anger. 
Katherine's blue eyes sparkling and dancing as she pirouetted in her new white gown. The glimmer of 
white behind a lemon tree. The feel of a sword in his hand; Giuseppe's voice shouting from far away. The 
lemon tree. He must not go behind the lemon tree. He saw Damon's face again, but this time his brother 
was laughing wildly. Laughing on and on, a sound like the grate of broken glass. And the lemon tree was 
closer now... 


"Damon-Katherine-no!" 

"Damon-Katherine-no!" 

He ran shaking hands through his hair and steadied his breath. 

A terrible dream. It had been a long time since he had been tortured by dreams like that; long, indeed, 
since he'd dreamed at all. The last few seconds played over and over again in his mind, and he saw again 
the lemon tree and heard again his brother's laughter. 

It echoed in his mind almost too clearly. Suddenly, without being aware of a conscious decision to move, 
Stefan found himself at the open window. The night air Was cool on his cheeks as he looked into the 
silvery dark. 

"Damon?" He sent the thought out on a surge of Power, questing. Then he fell into absolute stillness, 
listening with all his senses. 

He could feel nothing, no ripple of response. Nearby, a pair of night birds rose in flight. In the town, 
many minds were sleeping; in the woods, nocturnal animals went about their secret business. 

He sighed and turned back into the room. Perhaps he'd been wrong about the laughter; perhaps he'd 
even been wrong about the menace in the graveyard. Fell's Church was still, and peaceful, and he should 
try to emulate it. He needed sleep. 

September 5 (actually early September 6-about 1:00 a.m.) Dear Diary, 

I should go back to bed soon. Just a few minutes ago I woke up thinking someone was shouting, 
but now the house is quiet. So many strange things have happened tonight that my nerves are 
shot, I guess. 

At least I woke up knowing exactly what I'm going to do about Stefan. The whole thing just sort 
of sprang into my mind. Plan B, Phase One, begins tomorrow. 

Frances's eyes were blazing, and her cheeks were flushed with color as she approached the three girls at 
the table. 

"Oh, Elena, you've got to hear this!" 

Elena smiled at her, polite but not too intimate. Frances ducked her brown head. "I mean... can I join 

Page 32 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
you? I've just heard the wildest thing about Stefan Salvatore." 


"Have a seat," said Elena graciously. "But," she added, buttering a roll, "we're not really interested in the 
news." 


"You-?" Frances stared. She looked at Meredith, then at Bonnie. "You guys are joking, right?" 


"Not at all." Meredith speared a green bean and eyed it thoughtfully. "We have other things on our minds 
today." 


"Exactly," said Bonnie after a sudden start. "Stefan's old news, you know. Passe." She bent down and 
rubbed her ankle. 


. 
Frances looked at Elena appealingly. "But I thought you wanted to know all about him." 


"Curiosity," Elena said. "After all, he is a visitor, and I wanted to welcome him to Fell's Church. But of 
course I have to be loyal to Jean-Claude." 
"Jean-Claude?" 
"Jean-Claude," said Meredith, raising her eyebrows and sighing. 
"Jean-Claude," echoed Bonnie gamely. 
Delicately, with thumb and forefinger, Elena drew a photo out of her backpack. "Here he is standing in 


front of the cottage where we stayed. Right afterward he picked me a flower and said..."Well,"-she 


smiled mysteriously-"I shouldn't repeat it." 
Frances was gazing at the photo. It showed a bronzed young man, shirtless, standing in front of a hibiscus 
bush and smiling shyly. "He's older, isn't he?" she said with respect. 


"Twenty-one. Of course,"-Elena glanced over Tier shoulder-"my aunt would never approve, so we're 
keeping it from her until I graduate. We have to write to each other secretly." 


"How romantic," Frances breathed. "I'll never tell a soul, I promise. But about Stefan..." 
Elena gave her a superior smile. "If," she said, "I am going to eat Continental, I prefer French to Italian 
every time." She turned to Meredith. "Right?" 


"Mm-hmm. Every time." Meredith and Elena smiled knowingly at each other, then turned to Frances. 


"Don't you agree?" 
"Oh, yes," said Frances hastily. "Me, too. Every time." She smiled knowingly herself and nodded several 
times as she got up and left. 


When she was gone, Bonnie said piteously, "This is going to kill me. Elena, I am going to die if I don't 


Page 33 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
hear the gossip." 
"Oh, that? I can tell you," Elena replied calmly. "She was going to say there's a rumor going around that 
Stefan Salvatore is a narc." 


"A what!" Bonnie stared, and then burst into laughter. "But that's ridiculous. What narc in the world 
would dress like that and wear dark glasses? I mean, he's done everything he can to draw attention to 
himself..." Her voice trailed off, and her brown eyes widened. "But then, that may be why he does it. 
Who would ever suspect anybody so obvious? And he does live alone, and he's awfully secretive... 
Elena! What if it's true?" 


"It isn't," said Meredith. 
"How do you know?" 
"Because I'm the one who started it." At Bonnie's expression, she grinned and added: "Elena told me to." 
"Ohhhh." Bonnie looked admiringly at Elena. "You're wicked. Can I tell people he's got a terminal 


disease?" 
"No, you cannot. I don't want any Florence Nightingale types lining up to hold his hand. But you can tell 
people whatever you want about Jean-Claude." 


. 
Bonnie picked up the photograph. "Who was he really?" 
"The gardener. He was crazy about those hibiscus bushes. He was also married, with two kids." 
"Pity," said Bonnie seriously. "And you told Frances not to tell anyone about him..." 
"Right." Elena checked her watch. "Which means that by, oh, say two o'clock, it ought to be all over the 


school." 


After school, the girls went to Bonnie's house. They were greeted at the front door by a shrill yapping, 
and when Bonnie opened the door, a very old, very fat Pekingese tried to escape. His name was 
Yangtze, and he was so spoiled that no one except Bonnie's mother could stand him. He nipped at 
Elena's ankle as she went by. 


The living room was dim and crowded, with lots of rather fussy furniture and heavy curtains at the 
windows. Bonnie's sister Mary was there, unpinning a cap from her wavy red hair. She was just two 
years older than Bonnie, and she worked at the Fell's Church clinic. 


"Oh, Bonnie," she said, "I'm glad you're back. Hello, Elena, Meredith." 


Elena and Meredith said "hello." "What's the matter? You look tired," said Bonnie. 


Mary dropped her cap on the coffee table. Instead of answering, she asked a question in return. "Last 
night when you came home so upset, where did you say you girls had been?" 


Page 34 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
"Down in the-Just down by Wickery Bridge." 


"That's what I thought." Mary took a deep breath. "Now, you listen to me, Bonnie McCullough. Don't 
you ever go out there again, and especially not alone and at night. Do you understand?" 


"But why not?" Bonnie asked, bewildered. 


"Because last night somebody was attacked out there, that's why not. And do you know where they 
found him? Right on the bank under Wickery Bridge." 


Elena and Meredith stared at her in disbelief, and Bonnie clutched at Elena's arm. "Somebody was 
attacked under the bridge? But who was it? What happened?" 


"I don't know. This morning one of the cemetery workers spotted him lying there. He was some 
homeless person, I guess, and he'd probably been sleeping under the bridge when he was attacked. But 
he was half dead when they brought him in, and he hasn't regained consciousness yet. He may die." 


Elena swallowed. "What do you mean, attacked?" 


"I mean," said Mary distinctly, "that his throat was nearly ripped out. He lost an incredible amount of 
blood. They thought it might have been an animal at first, but now Dr. Lowen says it was a person. And 
the police think whoever did it may be hiding in the cemetery." Mary looked at each of them in turn, her 
mouth a straight line. "So if you were there by the bridge-or in the cemetery, Elena Gilbert-then this 
person may have been there with you. Get it?" 


"You don't have to scare us anymore," said Bonnie faintly. "We get the point, Mary." 


"All right. Good." Mary's shoulders slumped, and she rubbed at the back of her neck wearily. "I've got to 


. 
lie down for a while. I didn't mean to be crabby." She walked out of the living room. 
Alone, the three girls looked at one another. 
"It could have been one of us," said Meredith quietly. "Especially you, Elena; you went there alone." 
Elena's skin was prickling, that same painfully alert feeling she'd had in the old graveyard. She could feel 


the chill of the wind and see the rows of tall tombstones all around her. Sunshine and Robert E. Lee had 


never seemed so far away. 
"Bonnie," she said slowly, "did you see somebody out there? Is that what you meant when you said 
someone was waiting for me?" 


In the dim room, Bonnie looked at her blankly. "What are you talking about? I didn't say that." 
"Yes, you did." 
"No, I didn't. I never said that." 
"Bonnie," said Meredith, "we both heard you. You stared out at the old gravestones, and then you told 


Elena-" 


Page 35 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
"I don't know what you're talking about, and I didn't say anything." Bonnie's face was pinched with 
anger, but there were tears in her eyes. "I don't want to talk about it anymore." 
Elena and Meredith looked at one another helplessly. Outside, the sun went behind a cloud. 


Chapter Six 


&laquo; ^ &raquo; 


September 26 


Dear Diary, 


I'm sorry it's been so long, and I can't really explain why I haven't written-except that there are 
so many things I feel frightened to talk about, even to you. 


First, the most terrible thing happened. The day that Bonnie and Meredith and I were at the 
cemetery, an old man was attacked there, and almost killed. The police still haven't found the 
person who did it. People think the old man was crazy, because when he woke up he started 
raving about "eyes in the dark" and oak trees and things. But I remember what happened t us 
that night, and I wonder. It scares me. 


Everyone was scared for a while, and all the kids had to stay inside after dark or go out in groups. 
But it's been about three weeks now, and no more attacks, so the excitement is dying down. Aunt 
Judith says it must have been another vagrant that did it. Tyler Smallwood's father even 
suggested that the old man might have done it to himself-though I would like to see somebody 
bite himself in the throat. 


But mostly what I've been busy with is Plan B. As far as it goes, it's been going well. I've gotten 
several letters and a bouquet of red roses from "Jean-Claude" (Meredith's uncle is a florist), and 
everybody seems to have forgotten that I was ever interested in Stefan. So my social position's 


. 
secure. Even Caroline hasn't been making any trouble. 


secure. Even Caroline hasn't been making any trouble. 


There's only one thing I do care about right now. Stefan. 


Even Bonnie and Meredith don't realize how important he is to me. I'm afraid to tell them; I'm 
afraid they'll think I'm crazy. At school I wear a mask of calm and control, but on the inside-
well, every day it just gets worse. 


Aunt Judith has started to worry about me. She says I don't eat enough these days, and she's right. 
I can't seem to concentrate on my classes, or even on anything fun like the Haunted House 
fund-raiser. I can't concentrate on anything but him. And I don't even understand why. 


He hasn't spoken to me since that horrible afternoon. But I'll tell you something strange. Last 
week in history class, I glanced up and caught him looking at me. We were sitting a few seats 


Page 36 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
apart, and he was turned completely sideways in his desk, just looking. For a moment I felt almost 
frightened, and my heart started pounding, and we just stared at each other-and then he looked 
away. But since then it's happened twice more, and each time I felt his eyes on me before I saw 
them. This is the literal truth. I know it's not my imagination. 


He isn't like any boy I've ever known. 


He seems so isolated, so lonely. Even though it's his own choice. He's made quite a hit on the 
football team, but he doesn't hang around with any of the guys, except maybe Matt. Matt's the 
only one he talks to. He doesn't hang around with any girls, either, that I can see, so maybe the 
narc rumor is doing some good. But it's more like he's avoiding other people than they're avoiding 
him. He disappears in between classes and after football practice, and I've never once seen him in 
the cafeteria. He's never invited anybody to his room at the boarding house. He never visits the 
coffee shop after school. 


So how can I ever get him someplace where he can't run from me? This is the real problem with 
Plan B. Bonnie says, "Why not get stuck in a thunderstorm with him, so you have to huddle 
together to conserve body warmth?" And Meredith suggested that my car could break down in 
front of the boarding house. But neither of those ideas is practical, and I'm going insane trying to 
come up with something better. 


Every day it's getting worse for me. I feel as if I were a clock or something, winding up tighter and 
tighter. If I don't find something to do soon, I'll-


I was going to say "die." 


The solution came to her quite suddenly and simply. 


She felt sorry about Matt; she knew he'd been hurt by the Jean-Claude rumor. He'd hardly spoken to her 
since the story had broken, usually passing her with a quick nod. And when she ran into him one day in 
an empty hall outside of Creative Writing, he wouldn't meet her eyes. 


"Matt-" she began. She wanted to tell him that it wasn't true, that she would never have started seeing 
another boy without telling him first. She wanted to tell him that she'd never meant to hurt him, and that 
she felt terrible now. But she didn't know how to begin. Finally, she just blurted out, "I'm sorry!" and 
turned to go in to class. 


. 
"Elena," he said, and she turned back. He was looking at her now, at least, his eyes lingering on her lips, 
her hair. Then he shook his head as if to say the joke was on him. "Is this French guy for real?" he finally 
demanded. 


"Elena," he said, and she turned back. He was looking at her now, at least, his eyes lingering on her lips, 
her hair. Then he shook his head as if to say the joke was on him. "Is this French guy for real?" he finally 
demanded. 


"About Stefan. I get it." Matt nodded, looking both grimmer and somewhat more understanding. "Look, 
Elena, that was pretty lousy of him. But I don't think he meant it personally. He's that way with 
everybody-" 


"Except you." 


Page 37 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
"No. He talks to me, sometimes, but not about anything personal. He never says anything about his family 
or what he does outside of school. It's like-like there's a wall around him that I can't get through. I don't 
think he'll ever let anybody get through that wall. Which is a damn shame, because I think that behind it 
he's miserable." 


Elena pondered this, fascinated by a view of Stefan she'd never considered before. He always seemed so 
controlled, so calm and undisturbed. But then, she knew she seemed that way herself to other people. 
Was it possible that underneath he was as confused and unhappy as she was? 


It was then that the idea came, and it was ridiculously simple. No complicated schemes, no 
thunderstorms or cars breaking down. 


"Matt," she said, slowly, "don't you think it would be a good thing if somebody did get behind that wall? 
A good thing for Stefan, I mean? Don't you think that would be the best thing that could happen to him?" 
She looked up at him intensely, willing him to understand. 


He stared at her a moment, then shut his eyes briefly and shook his head in disbelief. "Elena," he said, 
"you are incredible. You twist people around your little finger, and I don't think you even know you're 
doing it. And now you're going to ask me to do something to help you ambush Stefan, and I'm such a 
dumb sucker I might even agree to do it." 


"You're not dumb, you're a gentleman. And I do want to ask you a favor, .but only if you think it's right. I 
don't want to hurt Stefan, and I don't want to hurt you." 


"Don't you?" 


"No. I know how that must sound, but it's true. I only want-" She broke off again. How could she 
explain what she wanted when she didn't even understand it herself? 


"You only want everybody and everything revolving around Elena Gilbert," he said bitterly. "You only 
want everything you don't have." 


Shocked, she stepped back and looked at him. Her throat swelled, and warmth gathered in her eyes. 


"Don't," he said. "Elena, don't look like that. I'm sorry." He sighed. "All right, what is it I'm supposed to 
do? Hog-tie him and dump him on your doorstep?" 


"No," said Elena, still trying to make the tears go back where they belonged. "I only wanted you to get 
him to come to the Homecoming Dance next week." 


Mart's expression was odd. "You just want him to be at the dance." 


. 
Elena nodded. 
"All right. I'm pretty sure he'll be there. And, Elena... there really isn't anybody but you I want to take." 
"All right," said Elena after a moment. "And, well, thank you." 
Matt's expression was still peculiar. "Don't thank me, Elena. It's nothing... really." She was puzzling over 


that when he turned away and walked down the hall. 


Page 38 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
"Hold still," said Meredith, giving Elena's hair a reproving twitch. 

"I still think," said Bonnie from the window seat, "that they were both wonderful." 

"Who?" Elena murmured absently. 

"As if you didn't know," said Bonnie. "Those two guys of yours who pulled off the last-minute miracle at 
the game yesterday. When Stefan caught that last pass, I thought I was going to faint. Or throw up." 

"Oh, please," said Meredith. 

"And Matt-that boy is simply poetry in motion..." 

"And neither of them is mine," Elena said flatly. Under Meredith's expert fingers, her hair was becoming a 
work of art, a soft mass of twisted gold. And the dress was all right; the iced-violet color brought out the 
violet in her eyes. But even to herself she looked pale and steely, not softly flushed with excitement but 
white and determined, like a very young soldier being sent to the front lines. 

Standing on the football field yesterday when her name was announced as Homecoming Queen, there 
had been only one thought in her mind. He couldn't refuse to dance with her. If he came to the dance at 
all, he couldn't refuse the Homecoming Queen. And standing in front of the mirror now, she said it to 
herself again. 

"Tonight anyone you want will be yours," Bonnie was saying soothingly. "And, listen, when you get rid of 
Matt, can I take him off and comfort him?" 

Meredith snorted. "What's Raymond going to think?" 

"Oh, you can comfort him. But, really, Elena, I like Matt. And once you home in on Stefan, your 
threesome is going to get a little crowded. So..." 

"Oh, do whatever you want. Matt deserves some consideration." He's certainly not getting it from me, 
Elena thought. She still couldn't exactly believe what she was doing to him. But just now she couldn't 
afford to second-guess herself; she needed all her strength and concentration. 

"There." Meredith put the last pin in Elena's hair. "Now look at us, the Homecoming Queen and her court 
-or part of it, anyway. We're beautiful." 

"Is that the royal 'we'?" Elena said mockingly, but it was true. They were beautiful. Meredith's dress was 
a pure sweep of burgundy satin, gathered tight at the waist and pouring into folds from the hips. Her dark 
hair hung loose down her back. And Bonnie, as she stood up and joined the others in front of the mirror, 
was like a shimmering party favor in pink taffeta and black sequins. 

As for herself... Elena scanned her image with an experienced eye and thought again, The dress is all 



Page 39 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
right. The only other phrase that came to mind was crystallized violets. Her grandmother had kept a 


little jar of them, real flowers dipped in crystallized sugar and frozen. 
They went downstairs together, as they had for every dance since the seventh grade-except that before, 
Caroline had always been with them. Elena realized with faint surprise that she didn't even know who 
Caroline was going with tonight. 


Aunt Judith and Robert-soon to be Uncle Robert-were in the living room, along with Margaret in her 


pajamas. 
"Oh, you girls all look lovely," said Aunt Judith, as fluttery and excited as if she were going to the dance 
herself. She kissed Elena, and Margaret held up her arms for a hug. 


"You're pretty," she said with four-year-old simplicity. 
Robert was looking at Elena, too. He blinked, opened his mouth, and closed it again. 
"What's the matter, Bob?" 
"On." He looked at Aunt Judith, seeming embarrassed. "Well, actually, it just occurred to me that Elena is 


a form of the name Helen. And for some reason I was thinking of Helen of Troy." 
"Beautiful and doomed," said Bonnie happily. 
"Well, yes," said Robert, not looking happy at all. Elena said nothing. 
The doorbell rang. Matt was on the step, in his familiar blue sports coat. With him were Ed Goff, 


Meredith's date, and Raymond Hernandez, Bonnie's. Elena looked for Stefan. 
"He's probably already there," said Matt, interpreting her glance. "Listen, Elena-" 
But whatever he had been about to say was cut off in the chatter from the other couples. Bonnie and 


Raymond went with them in Matt's car, and kept up a constant stream of witticisms all the way to the 


school. 
Music drifted out the open doors of the auditorium. As Elena stepped out of the car, a curious certainty 
rushed over her. Something was going to happen, she realized, looking at the square bulk of the school 
building. The peaceful low gear of the last few weeks was about to slip into high. 


I'm ready, she thought. And hoped it was true. 
Inside, it was a kaleidoscope of color and activity. She and Matt were mobbed the instant they came in, 


and compliments rained down on both of them. Elena's dress... her hair... her flowers. Matt was a 
legend in the making: another Joe Montana, a sure bet for an athletic scholarship. 
In the dizzying whirl that should have been life and breath to her, Elena kept searching for one dark head. 
Tyler Smallwood was breathing heavily on her, smelling of punch and Brut and Doublemint gum. His date 


Page 40 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
was looking murderous. Elena ignored him in the hopes that he would go away. 
Mr. Tanner passed by with a soggy paper cup, looking as if his collar was strangling him. Sue Carson, 


the other senior homecoming princess, breezed up and cooed over the violet dress. Bonnie was already 
out on the dance floor, shimmering under the lights. But nowhere did Elena see Stefan. 
One more whiff of Doublemint and she was going to be sick. She nudged Matt and they escaped to the 


. 
refreshment table, where Coach Lyman launched into a critique of the game. Couples and groups came 
up to them, spending a few minutes and then retreating to make room for the next in line. Just as if we 
really were royalty, thought Elena wildly. She glanced sideways to see if Matt shared her amusement, but 
he was looking fixedly off to his left.

really were royalty, thought Elena wildly. She glanced sideways to see if Matt shared her amusement, but 
he was looking fixedly off to his left. 


"Now what?" said Matt, his jaw set. "The hog-tying?" 


"No. I'm going to ask him to dance, that's all. I'll wait until we've danced first, if you want." 


He shook his head, and she set out toward Stefan through the crowd. 


Piece by piece, Elena registered information about him as she approached. His black blazer was of a 
subtly different cut than the other boys', more elegant, and he wore a white cashmere sweater under it. 
He stood quite still, not fidgeting, a little apart from the groups around him. And, although she could see 
him only in profile, she could see he wasn't wearing his glasses. 


He took them off for football, of course, but she'd never seen him close up without them. It made her feel 
giddy and excited, as if this were a masquerade and the unmasking time had come. 


She focused on his shoulder, the line of his jaw, and then he was turning toward her. 


In that instant, Elena was aware that she was beautiful. It wasn't just the dress, or the way her hair was 
done. She was beautiful in herself: slender, imperial, a thing made of silk and inner fire. She saw his lips 
part slightly, reflexively, and then she looked up into his eyes. 


"Hello." Was that her own voice, so quiet and self-assured? His eyes were green. Green as oak leaves in 
summer. "Are you having a good time?" she said. 


I am now. He didn't say it, but she knew it was what he was thinking; she could see it in the way he 
stared at her. She had never been so sure of her power. Except that actually he didn't look as if he were 
having a good time; he looked stricken, in pain, as if he couldn't take one more minute of this. 


The band was starting up, a slow dance. He was still staring at her, drinking her in. Those green eyes 
darkening, going black with desire. She had the sudden feeling that he might jerk her to him and kiss her 


Page 41 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
hard, without ever saying a word. 


"Would you like to dance?" she said softly. I'm playing with fire, with something I don't understand, she 
thought suddenly. And in that instant she realized that she was frightened. Her heart began to pound 
violently. It was as if those green eyes spoke to some part of her that was buried deep beneath the 
surface-and that part was screaming "danger" at her. Some instinct older than civilization was telling her 
to run, to flee. 


She never moved. The same force that was terrifying her was holding her there. This is out of control, she 
thought suddenly. Whatever was happening here was beyond her understanding, was nothing normal or 
sane. But there was no stopping it now, and even while frightened she was reveling in it. It was the most 
intense moment she'd ever experienced with a boy, but nothing at all was happening. He was just gazing 
at her, as if hypnotized, and she was gazing back, while the energy shimmered between them like heat 
lightning. She saw his eyes go darker, defeated, and felt the wild leap of her own heart as he slowly 
stretched out one hand. 


. 
And then it all shattered. 


And then it all shattered. 


"And that little dress is so pretty," continued Caroline, while Elena's mind kept on running on automatic. 
That casually possessive arm linked with Stefan's told her everything: where Caroline had been at lunch 
these past weeks, what she had been up to all this time. "I told Stefan we simply had to stop by for a 
moment, but we're not going to stay long. So you don't mind if I keep him to myself for the dances, do 
you?" 


Elena was strangely calm now, her mind a humming blank. She said no, of course she didn't mind, and 
watched Caroline move away, a symphony in auburn and gold. Stefan went with her. 


There was a circle of faces around Elena; she turned from them and came up against Matt. 


"You knew he was coming with her." 


"I knew she wanted him to. She's been following him around at lunchtime and after school, and kind of 
forcing herself on him. But..." 


"I see." Still held in that queer, artificial calm, she scanned the crowd and saw Bonnie coming toward her, 
and Meredith leaving her table. They'd seen, then. Probably everyone had. Without a word to Matt, she 
moved toward them, heading instinctively for the girls' rest room. 


It was packed with bodies, and Meredith and Bonnie kept their remarks bright and casual while looking 
at her with concern. 


"Did you see that dress?" said Bonnie, squeezing Elena's fingers secretly. "The front must be held on with 
superglue. And what's she going to wear to the next dance? Cellophane?" 


"Handiwrap," said Meredith. She added in a low voice, "Are you okay?" 


"Yes." Elena could see in the mirror that her eyes were too bright and that there was one spot of color 
burning on each cheek. She smoothed her hair and turned away. 


Page 42 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
The room emptied, leaving them in privacy. Bonnie was fiddling nervously with the sequined bow at her 
waist now. "Maybe it isn't such a bad thing after all," she said quietly. "I mean, you haven't thought about 
anything else but him in weeks. Nearly a month. And so maybe it's just for the best, and you can move 
on to other things now, instead of... well, chasing him." 


Et tu, Brute? thought Elena. "Thank you so much for your support," she said aloud. 


"Now, Elena, don't be like that," Meredith put in. "She isn't trying to hurt you, she just thinks-" 


"And I suppose you think so, too? Well, that's fine. I'll just go out and find myself some other things to 
move on to. Like some other best friends." She left them both staring after her. 


Outside, she threw herself into the whirl of color and music. She was brighter than she had ever been at 
any dance before. She danced with everyone, laughing too loudly, flirting with every boy in her path. 


. 
They were calling her to come up and be crowned. She stood on the stage, looking down on the 
butterfly-bright figures below. Someone gave her flowers; someone put a rhinestone tiara on her head. 
There was clapping. It all passed as if in a dream.

There was clapping. It all passed as if in a dream. 


She could smell alcohol along with the mint on Tyler's breath now, and his face was red. His friends were 
around her, a shouting, laughing crowd, and she saw Dick pour something from a brown paper bag into 
his glass of punch. 


She'd never been with this group before. They welcomed her, admiring her, the boys vying for her 
attention. Jokes flew back and forth, and Elena laughed even when they didn't make sense. Tyler's arm 
circled her waist, and she just laughed harder. Out of the corner of her eye she saw Matt shake his head 
and walk away. The girls were getting shrill, the boys rowdy. Tyler was nuzzling moistly at her neck. 


"I've got an idea," he announced to the group, hugging Elena more tightly to him. "Let's go someplace 
more fun." 


Somebody shouted, "Like where, Tyler? Your dad's house?" 


Tyler was grinning, a big, boozy, reckless grin. "No, I mean someplace where we can leave our mark. 
Like the cemetery." 


The girls squealed. The boys elbowed each other and faked punches. 


Tyler's date was still standing outside the circle. "Tyler, that's crazy," she said, her voice high and thin. 
"You know what happened to that old man. I won't go there." 


"Great, then, you stay here." Tyler fished keys out of his pocket and waved them at the rest of the crowd. 
"Who isn't afraid?" he said. 


"Hey, I'm up for it," said Dick, and there was a chorus of approval. 


Page 43 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
"Me, too," said Elena, clear and defiant. She smiled up at Tyler, and he practically swung her off her feet. 
And then she and Tyler were leading a noisy, roughhousing group out into the parking lot, where they 


were all piling into cars. And then Tyler was putting the top of his convertible down and she was climbing 
in, with Dick and a girl named Vickie Bennett squashing into the back seat. 
"Elena!" somebody shouted, far away, from the lighted doorway at the school. 
"Drive," she said to Tyler, taking off her tiara, and the engine growled to life. They burned rubber out of 


the parking lot, and the cool night wind blew into Elena's face.

Bonnie was on the dance floor, eyes shut, letting the music flow through her. When she opened her eyes 


for an instant, Meredith was beckoning from the sidelines. Bonnie thrust her chin out mutinously, but as

"Elena just left," said Meredith. 
"It's a free country," said Bonnie. 
"She went with Tyler Smallwood," said Meredith. "Matt, are you sure you didn't hear where they were 


going?" 


Matt shook his head. "I'd say she deserves whatever happens-but it's my fault, too, in a way," he said 
bleakly. "I guess we ought to go after her." 
"Leave the dance?" Bonnie said. She looked at Meredith, who mouthed the words you promised. "I 


don't believe this," she muttered savagely. 


"I don't know how we'll find her," said Meredith, "but we've got to try." Then she added, in a strangely 
hesitant voice, "Bonnie, you don't happen to know where she is, do you?" 
"What? No, of course not; I've been dancing. You've heard of that, haven't you: what you go to a dance 


for?" 
"You and Ray stay here," Matt said to Ed. "If she comes back, tell her we're out looking." 
"And if we're going, we'd better go now," Bonnie put in ungraciously. She turned and promptly ran into a 


dark blazer. 
"Well, excuse me," she snapped, looking up and seeing Stefan Salvatore. He said nothing as she and 
Meredith and Matt headed for the door, leaving an unhappy-looking Raymond and Ed behind. 


Page 44 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
The stars were distant and ice-bright in the cloudless sky. Elena felt just like them. Part of her was 
laughing and shouting with Dick and Vickie and Tyler over the roar of the wind, but part of her was 
watching from far away. 


Tyler parked halfway up the hill to the ruined church, leaving his headlights on as they all got out. 
Although there had been several cars behind them when they left the school, they appeared to be the only 
ones who'd made it all the way to the cemetery. 


Tyler opened the trunk and pulled out a six-pack. "All the more for us." He offered a beer to Elena, who 
shook her head, trying to ignore the sick feeling in the pit of her stomach. She felt all wrong being here-
but there was no way she was going to admit that now. 


They climbed the flagstone path, the girls staggering in their high heels and leaning on the boys. When 
they reached the top, Elena gasped and Vickie gave a little scream. 


Something huge and red was hovering just above the horizon. It took Elena a moment to realize it was 
actually the moon. It was as large and unrealistic as a prop in a science-fiction movie, and its bloated 
mass glowed dully with an unwholesome light. 


"Like a big rotten pumpkin," said Tyler, and lobbed a stone at it. Elena made herself smile brilliantly up at 
him. 


. 
"Why don't we go inside?" Vickie said, pointing a white hand at the empty hole of the church doorway. 


"Why don't we go inside?" Vickie said, pointing a white hand at the empty hole of the church doorway. 


A light flared by Elena's cheek, and she turned, startled, to see Tyler holding a lighter. He grinned, 
showing strong white teeth, and said, "Want to flick my Bic?" 


Elena's laughter was the loudest, to cover her uneasiness. She took the lighter, using it to illuminate the 
tomb in the side of the church. It was like no other tomb in the cemetery, although her father said he'd 
seen similar things in England. It looked like a large stone box, big enough for two people, with two 
marble statues lying in repose on the lid. 


"Thomas Keeping Fell and Honoria Fell," said Tyler with a grand gesture, as if introducing them. "Old 
Thomas allegedly founded Fell's Church. Although actually the Smallwoods were also there at the time. 
My great-grandfather's great-great-grandfather lived in the valley by Drowning Creek-" 


"-until he got eaten by wolves," said Dick, and he threw back his head in a wolf imitation. Then he 
belched. Vickie giggled. Annoyance crossed Tyler's handsome features, but he forced a smile. 


"Thomas and Honoria are looking kind of pale," said Vickie, still giggling. "I think what they need is a little 
color." She produced a lipstick from her purse and began to coat the white marble mouth of the woman's 
statue with waxy scarlet. Elena felt another sick twinge. As a child, she'd always been awed by the pale 
lady and the grave man who lay with their eyes closed, hands folded on their breasts. And, after her 
parents died, she'd thought of them as lying side by side like this down in the cemetery. But she held the 
lighter while the other girl put a lipstick mustache and clown's nose on Thomas Fell. 


Tyler was watching them. "Hey, they're all dressed up with no place to go." He put his hands on the edge 
of the stone lid and leaned on it, trying to shift it sideways. "What do you say, Dick-want to give them a 


Page 45 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
night out on the town? Like maybe right in the center of town?" 


No, thought Elena, appalled, as Dick guffawed and Vickie shrieked with laughter. But Dick was already 
beside Tyler, getting braced and ready, the heels of his hands on the stone lid. 
"On three," said Tyler, and counted, "One, two, three." 
Elena's eyes were fixed on the horrible clown-like face of Thomas Fell as the boys strained forward and 


grunted, muscles bunching under cloth. They couldn't budge the lid an inch. 
"Damn thing must be attached somehow," said Tyler angrily, turning away. 
Elena felt weak with relief. Trying to seem casual, she leaned against the stone lid of the tomb for support 


-and that was when it happened. 
She heard the grinding of stone and felt the lid shift under her left hand all at once. It was moving away 
from her, making her lose her balance. The lighter went flying, and she screamed and screamed again, 


trying to keep her feet. She was falling into the open tomb, and an icy wind roared all around her. 
Screams rang in her ears. 
And then she was outside and the moonlight was bright enough that she could see the others. Tyler had 


hold of her. She stared around her wildly. 
"Are you crazy? What happened?" Tyler was shaking her. 
. 


"It moved! The lid moved! It slid open and-I don't know-I almost fell in. It was cold..." 
"It moved! The lid moved! It slid open and-I don't know-I almost fell in. It was cold..." 
But they went inside anyway. Vickie hung in the doorway, watching, while Elena shivered. Presently, 


Tyler beckoned her from the door. 


"Look," he said when she reluctantly stepped back inside. He'd retrieved the lighter, and he held it above 
Thomas Fell's marble chest. "It still fits, snug as a bug in a rug. See?" 
Elena stared down at the perfect alignment of lid and tomb. "It did move. I nearly fell into it..." 
"Sure, whatever you say, baby." Tyler wound his arms around her, clasping her to him backwards. She 


looked over to see Dick and Vickie in much the same position, except that Vickie, eyes shut, was 
looking as if she enjoyed it. Tyler rubbed a strong chin over her hair. 

"I'd like to go back to the dance now," she said flatly. 
There was a pause in the rubbing. Then Tyler sighed and said, "Sure, baby." He looked at Dick and 
Vickie. "What about you two?" 


Dick grinned. "We'll just stay here a while." Vickie giggled, her eyes still shut. 
"Okay." Elena wondered how they were going to get back, but she allowed Tyler to lead her out. Once 
outside, however, he paused. 


Page 46 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
"I can't let you go without one look at my grandfather's headstone," he said. "Aw, c'mon, Elena," he said 
as she started to protest, "don't hurt my feelings. You've got to see it; it's the family pride and joy." 


Elena made herself smile, although her stomach felt like ice. Maybe if she humored him, he would get her 
out of here. "All right," she said, and started toward the cemetery. 


"Not that way. This way." And the next moment, he was leading her down toward the old graveyard. 
"It's okay, honest, it's not far off the path. Look, there, you see?" He pointed to something that shone in 
the moonlight. 


Elena gasped, muscles tightening around her heart. It looked like a person standing there, a giant with a 
round hairless head. And she didn't like being here at all, among the worn and leaning granite stones of 
centuries past. The bright moonlight cast strange shadows, and there were pools of impenetrable 
darkness everywhere. 


"It's just the ball on top. Nothing to be scared of," said Tyler, pulling her with him off the path and up to 
the shining headstone. It was made of red marble, and the huge ball that surmounted it reminded her of 
the bloated moon on the horizon. Now that same moon shone down on them, as white as Thomas Fell's 
white hands. Elena couldn't contain her shivering. 


"Poor baby, she's cold. Got to get her warned up," said Tyler. Elena tried to push him away, but he was 
too strong, wrapping her in his arms, pulling her against him. 


"Tyler, I want to go; I want to go right now. ..." 


"Sure, baby, we'll go," he said. "But we've got to get you warm first. Gosh, you're cold." 


"Tyler, stop," she said. His arms around her had merely been annoying, restricting, but now with a sense 


. 
of shock she felt his hands on her body, groping for bare skin. 


of shock she felt his hands on her body, groping for bare skin. 


"C'mon, Elena, don't be like that, I just want to warm you up all over..." 


"Tyler, let go," she choked out. She tried to wrench herself away from him. Tyler stumbled, and then his 
full weight was on her, crushing her into the tangle of ivy and weeds on the ground. Elena spoke 
desperately. "I'll kill you, Tyler. I mean it. Get off me." 


Tyler tried to roll off, giggling suddenly, his limbs heavy and uncoordinated, almost useless. "Aw, c'mon, 
Elena, don' be mad. I was jus' warmin' you up. Elena the Ice Princess, warmin' up... You're gettin' warm 
now, aren' you?" Then Elena felt his mouth hot and wet on her face. She was still pinned beneath him, 
and his sloppy kisses were moving down her throat. She heard cloth tear. 


"Oops," Tyler mumbled. "Sorry 'bout that." 


Elena twisted her head, and her mouth met Tyler's hand, clumsily caressing her cheek. She bit it, sinking 
her teeth into the fleshy palm. She bit hard, tasting blood, hearing Tyler's agonized yowl. The hand 
jerked away. 


Page 47 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
"Hey! I said I was sorry!" Tyler looked aggrievedly at his maimed hand. Then his face darkened, as, still 
staring at it, he clenched the hand into a fist. 


This is it, Elena thought with nightmare calmness. He's either going to knock me out or kill me. She 
braced herself for the blow. 


Stefan had resisted coming into the cemetery; everything within him had cried out against it. The last time 
he'd been here had been the night of the old man. 


Horror shifted through his gut again at the memory. He would have sworn that he had not drained the 
man under the bridge, that he had not taken enough blood to do harm. But everything that night after the 
surge of Power was muddled, confused. If there had been a surge of Power at all. Perhaps that had been 
his own imagination, or even his own doing. Strange things could happen when the need got out of 
control. 


He shut his eyes. When he'd heard that the old man was hospitalized, near death, his shock had been 
beyond words. How could he have let himself get so far out of hand? To kill, almost, when he had not 
killed since... 


He wouldn't let himself think about that. 


Now, standing in front of the cemetery gate in the midnight darkness, he wanted nothing so much as to 
turn around and go away. Go back to the dance where he'd left Caroline, that supple, sun-bronzed 
creature who was absolutely safe because she meant absolutely nothing to him. 


But he couldn't go back, because Elena was in the cemetery. He could sense her, and sense her rising 
distress. Elena was in the cemetery and in trouble, and he had to find her. 


He was halfway up the hill when the dizziness hit. It sent him reeling, struggling on toward the church 
because it was the only thing he could keep in focus. Gray waves of fog swept through his brain, and he 


. 
fought to keep moving. Weak, he felt so weak. And helpless against the sheer power of this vertigo. 


fought to keep moving. Weak, he felt so weak. And helpless against the sheer power of this vertigo. 


The church door yawned before him. 


Elena saw the moon over Tyler's left shoulder. It was strangely fitting that it would be the last thing she 
ever saw, she thought. The scream had caught in her throat, choked off by fear. 


And then something picked Tyler up and threw him against his grandfather's headstone. 


That was what it looked like to Elena. She rolled to the side, gasping, one hand clutching her torn dress, 
the other groping for a weapon. 


She didn't need one. Something moved in the darkness, and she saw the person who had plucked Tyler 
off her. Stefan Salvatore. But it was a Stefan she had never seen before: that fine-featured face was white 
and cold with fury, and there was a killing light in those green eyes. Without even moving, Stefan 
emanated such anger and menace that Elena found herself more frightened of him than she had been of 


Page 48 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
Tyler. 

"When I first met you, I knew you'd never learned any manners," said Stefan. His voice was soft and 
cold and light, and somehow it made Elena dizzy. She couldn't take her eyes off him as he moved toward 
Tyler, who was shaking his head dazedly and starting to get up. Stefan moved like a dancer, every 
movement easy and precisely controlled. "But I had no idea that your character was quite so 
underdeveloped." 

He hit Tyler. The larger boy had been reaching out one beefy hand, and Stefan hit him almost negligently 
on the side of the face, before the hand made contact. 

Tyler flew against another headstone. He scrambled up and stood panting, his eyes showing white. Elena 
saw a trickle of blood from his nose. Then he charged. 

"A gentleman doesn't force his company on anyone," said Stefan, and knocked him aside. Tyler went 
sprawling again, facedown in the weeds and briars. This time he was slower in getting up, and blood 
flowed from both nostrils and from his mouth. He was blowing like a frightened horse as he threw himself 
at Stefan. 

Stefan grabbed the front of Tyler's jacket, whirling them both around and absorbing the impact of the 
murderous rush. He shook Tyler twice, hard, while those big beefy fists windmilled around him, unable to 
connect. Then he let Tyler drop. 

"He doesn't insult a woman," he said. Tyler's face was contorted, his eyes rolling, but he grabbed for 
Stefan's leg. Stefan jerked him to his feet and shook him again, and Tyler went limp as a rag doll, his eyes 
rolling up. Stefan went on speaking, holding the heavy body upright and punctuating every word with a 
bone-wrenching shake. "And, above all, he does not hurt her..." 

"Stefan!" Elena cried. Tyler's head was snapping back and forth with every shake. She was frightened of 
what she was seeing; frightened of what Stefan might do. And frightened above all else of Stefan's voice, 
that cold voice that was like a rapier dancing, beautiful and deadly and utterly merciless. "Stefan, stop." 

His head jerked toward her, startled, as if he had forgotten her presence. For a moment he looked at her 


without recognition, his eyes black in the moonlight, and she thought of some predator, some great bird 
or sleek carnivore incapable of human emotion. Then understanding came to his face and some of the 
darkness faded from his gaze. 

without recognition, his eyes black in the moonlight, and she thought of some predator, some great bird 
or sleek carnivore incapable of human emotion. Then understanding came to his face and some of the 
darkness faded from his gaze. 

"He'll be all right," said Stefan emptily. 

As her fear ebbed, Elena felt empty herself. Shock, she thought. I'm in shock. I'll probably start 
screaming hysterically any minute now. 

"Is there someone to take you home?" said Stefan, still in that chillingly deadened voice. 

Elena thought of Dick and Vickie, doing God knew what beside Thomas Fell's statue. "No," she said. 

Page 49 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
Her mind was beginning to work again, to take notice of things around her. The violet dress was ripped 
all the way down the front; it was ruined. Mechanically, she pulled it together over her slip. 

"I'll drive you," said Stefan. 

Even through the numbness, Elena felt a quick thrill of fear. She looked at him, a strangely elegant figure 
among the tombstones, his face pale in the moonlight. He had never looked so... so beautiful to her 
before, but that beauty was almost alien. Not just foreign, but inhuman, because no human could project 
that aura of power, or of distance. 

"Thank you. That would be very kind," she said slowly. There was nothing else to do. 

They left Tyler painfully getting to his feet by his ancestor's headstone. Elena felt another chill as they 
reached the path and Stefan turned toward Wickery Bridge. 

"I left my car at the boarding house," he said. "This is the fastest way for us to get back." 

"Is this the way you came?" 

"No. I didn't cross the bridge. But it'll be safe." 

Elena believed him. Pale and silent, he walked beside her without touching, except when he took off his 
blazer to put it around her bare shoulders. She felt oddly sure he would kill anything that tried to get at 
her. 

Wickery Bridge was white in the moonlight, and under it the icy waters swirled over ancient rocks. The 
whole world was still and beautiful and cold as they walked through the oak trees to the narrow country 
road. 

They passed fenced pastures and dark fields until they reached a long winding drive. The boarding house 
was a vast building of rust-red brick made from the native clay, and it was flanked with age-old cedars 
and maples. All but one of the windows were dark. 

Stefan unlocked one of the double doors and they stepped into a small hallway, with a flight of stairs 
directly in front of them. The banister, like the doors, was natural light oak so polished that it seemed to 
glow. 

They went up the stairs to a second-story landing that was poorly lit. To Elena's surprise, 


Stefan led her into one of the bedrooms and opened what looked like a closet door. Through it she could 
see a very steep, very narrow stairway. 

Stefan led her into one of the bedrooms and opened what looked like a closet door. Through it she could 
see a very steep, very narrow stairway. 

It was almost as dimly lit as the stairway, but Elena could see the stained wood floor and the exposed 
beams in the slanting ceiling. There were tall windows on all sides, and many trunks scattered among a 
few pieces of massive furniture. 

She realized he was watching her. "Is there a bathroom where I-?" 

Page 50 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
He nodded toward a door. She took off the blazer, held it toward him without looking at him, and went 
inside. 


Chapter Eight 


&laquo; ^ &raquo; 


Elena had gone into the bathroom dazed and numbly grateful. She came out angry. 


She wasn't quite sure how the transformation had taken place. But sometime while she was washing the 
scratches on her face and arms, annoyed at the lack of a mirror and at the fact she'd left her purse in 
Tyler's convertible, she started feeling again. And what she felt was anger. 


Damn Stefan Salvatore. So cold and controlled even while saving her life. Damn him for his politeness, 
and for his gallantry, and for the walls around him that seemed thicker and higher than ever. 


She pulled the remaining bobby pins out of her hair and used them to fasten the front of her dress 
together. Then she ran through her loosened hair quickly with an engraved bone comb she found by the 
sink. She came out of the bathroom with her chin held high and her eyes narrowed. 


He hadn't put his coat back on. He was standing by the window in his white sweater with bowed head, 
tense, waiting. Without lifting his head, he gestured to a length of dark velvet laid over the back of a chair. 


"You might want to put that on over your dress." 


It was a full-length cloak, very rich and soft, with a hood. Elena pulled the heavy material around her 
shoulders. But she was not mollified by the gift; she noticed that Stefan hadn't come any closer to her, or 
even looked at her while speaking. 


Deliberately, she invaded his territorial space, pulling the cloak more tightly about her and feeling, even at 
that moment, a sensual appreciation of the way the folds fell about her, trailing behind her on the floor. 
She walked up to him and made an examination of the heavy mahogany dresser by the window. 


On it lay a wicked-looking dagger with an ivory hilt and a beautiful agate cup mounted in silver. There 
were also a golden sphere with some sort of dial set into it and several loose gold coins. 


She picked up one of the coins, partly because it was interesting and partly because she knew it would 


. 
upset him to see her handling his things. "What's this?" 
It was a moment before he answered. Then he said: 
"A gold florin. A Florentine coin." 
"And what's this?" 
"A German pendant watch. Late fifteenth century," he said distractedly. He added, "Elena-" 
She reached for a small iron coffer with a hinged lid. "What about this? Does it open?" 
"No." He had the reflexes of a cat; his hand slapped over the coffer, holding the lid down. "That's 


private," he said, the strain obvious in his voice. 


Page 51 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
She noticed that his hand made contact only with the curving iron lid and not with her flesh. She lifted her 
fingers, and he drew back at once. 
Suddenly, her anger was too great to hold in any longer. "Careful," she said savagely. "Don't touch me, or 


you might get a disease." 
He turned away toward the window. 
And yet even as she moved away herself, walking back to the center of the room, she could sense his 


watching her reflection. And she knew, suddenly, what she must look like to him, pale hair spilling over 
the blackness of the cape, one white hand holding the velvet closed at her throat. A ravaged princess 
pacing in her tower. 


She tilted her head far back to look at the trapdoor in the ceiling, and heard a soft, distinct intake of 
breath. When she turned, his gaze was fixed on her exposed throat; the look in his eyes confused her. 
But the next moment his face hardened, closing her out. 


"I think," he said, "that I had better get you home." 
In that instant, she wanted to hurt him, to make him feel as bad as he'd made her feel. But she also 
wanted the truth. She was tired of this game, tired of scheming and plotting and trying to read Stefan 


Salvatore's mind. It was terrifying and yet a wonderful relief to hear her own voice saying the words she'd 
been thinking so long. 
"Why do you hate me?" 
He stared at her. For a moment he couldn't seem to find words. Then he said, "I don't hate you." 
"You do," said Elena. "I know it's not... not good manners to say it, but I don't care. I know I should be 


grateful to you for saving me tonight, but I don't care about that, either. I didn't ask you to save me. I 
don't know why you were even in the graveyard in the first place. And I certainly don't understand why 
you did it, considering the way you feel about me." 


He was shaking his head, but his voice was soft. "I don't hate you." 
"From the very beginning, you've avoided me as if I were... were some kind of leper. I tried to be 


friendly to you, and you threw it back in my face. Is that what a gentleman does when someone tries to 
welcome him?" 
He was trying to say something now, but she swept on, heedless. "You've snubbed me in public time 


. 
after time; you've humiliated me at school. You wouldn't be speaking to me now if it hadn't been a matter 
of life or death. Is that what it takes to get a word out of you? Does someone have to nearly be 
murdered? 


after time; you've humiliated me at school. You wouldn't be speaking to me now if it hadn't been a matter 
of life or death. Is that what it takes to get a word out of you? Does someone have to nearly be 


Page 52 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
murdered? 


He was silent now, his face averted. She took a deep breath and then straightened her shoulders, 
holding her head up even though her eyes were sore and burning. "And what's wrong with me," she 
added, more quietly, "that you can't even look at me, but you can let Caroline Forbes fall all over you? I 
have a right to know that, at least. I won't ever bother you again, I won't even talk to you at school, but I 
want to know the truth before I go. Why do you hate me so much, Stefan?" 


Slowly, he turned and raised his head. His eyes were bleak, sightless, and something twisted in Elena at 
the pain she saw on his face. 


His voice was still controlled-but barely. She could hear the effort it cost him to keep it steady. 


"Yes," he said, "I think you do have a right to know. Elena." He looked at her then, meeting her eyes 
directly, and she thought, That bad? What could be as bad as that? "I don't hate you," he continued, 
pronouncing each word carefully, distinctly. "I've never hated you. But you... remind me of someone." 


Elena was taken aback. Whatever she'd expected, it wasn't this. "I remind you of someone else you 
know?" 


"Of someone I knew," he said quietly. "But," he added slowly, as if puzzling something out for himself, 
"you're not like her, really. She looked like you, but she was fragile, delicate. Vulnerable. Inside as well 
as out." 


"And I'm not." 


He made a sound that would have been a laugh if there had been any humor in it. "No. You're a fighter. 
You are... yourself." 


Elena was silent for a moment. She could not keep hold of her anger, seeing the pain on his face. "You 
were very close to her?" 


"Yes." 


"What happened?" 


There was a long pause, so long that Elena thought he wasn't going to answer her. But at last he said, 
"She died." 


Elena let out a tremulous breath. The last of her anger folded up and disappeared from under her. "That 
must have hurt terribly," she said softly, thinking of the white Gilbert headstone among the rye grass. "I'm 
so sorry." 


He said nothing. His face had closed again, and he seemed to be looking far away at something, 
something terrible and heartbreaking that only he could see. But there was not just grief in his expression. 
Through the walls, through all his trembling control, she could see the tortured look of unbearable guilt 
and loneliness. A look so lost and haunted that she had moved to his side before she knew what she was 
doing. 


. 
"Stefan," she whispered. He didn't seem to hear her; he seemed to be adrift in his own world of misery. 


Page 53 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
She could not stop herself from laying a hand on his arm. "Stefan, I know how it can hurt-" 
"You can't know," he exploded, all his quietness erupting into white rage. He looked down at her hand 


as if just realizing it was there, as if infuriated at her effrontery in touching him. His green eyes were 


dilated and dark as he shook her hand off, flinging a hand up to bar her from touching him again-
-and somehow, instead, he was holding her hand, his fingers tightly interlocked with hers, hanging on for 
dear life. He looked down at their locked hands in bewilderment. Then, slowly, his gaze moved from 
their clasping fingers to her face. 


"Elena..." he whispered. 


And then she saw it, the anguish shattering his gaze, as if he simply couldn't fight any longer. The defeat as 
the walls finally crumbled and she saw what was underneath. 
And then, helplessly, he bent his head down to her lips. 


"Wait-stop here," said Bonnie. "I thought I saw something." 


Matt's battered Ford slowed, edging toward the side of the road, where brambles and bushes grew 
thickly. Something white glimmered there, coming toward them. 
"Oh, my God," said Meredith. "It's Vickie Bennett." 
The girl stumbled into the path of the headlights and stood there, wavering, as Matt hit the brakes. Her 


light-brown hair was tangled and in disarray, and her eyes stared glassily out of a face that was smudged 


and grimy with dirt. She was wearing only a thin white slip. 
"Get her in the car," said Matt. Meredith was already opening the car door. She jumped out and ran up 
to the dazed girl. 


"Vickie, are you all right? What happened to you?" 


Vickie moaned, still looking straight ahead. Then she suddenly seemed to see Meredith, and she clutched 
at her, digging her nails into Meredith's arms. 
"Get out of here," she said, her eyes filled with desperate intensity, her voice strange and thick, as if she 


had something in her mouth. "All of you-get out of here! It's coming." 
"What's coming? Vickie, where is Elena?" 
"Get out now. ..." 
Meredith looked down the road, then led the shaking girl back to the car. "We'll take you away," she 


Page 54 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
said, "but you have to tell us what's happened. Bonnie, give me your wrap. She's freezing." 


"She's been hurt," said Matt grimly. "And she's in shock or something. The question is, where are the 
others? Vickie, was Elena with you?" 
Vickie sobbed, putting her hands over her face as Meredith settled Bonnie's iridescent pink wrap around 


her shoulders. "No... Dick," she said indistinctly. It seemed to hurt her to speak. "We were in the church 


. 
... it was horrible. It came... like mist all around. Dark mist. And eyes. I saw its eyes in the dark there, 
burning. They burnt me..." 


"She's delirious," said Bonnie. "Or hysterical, or whatever you call it." 


Matt spoke slowly and clearly. "Vickie, please, just tell us one thing. Where is Elena? What happened to 
her?" 


"I don't know." Vickie lifted a tear-stained face to the sky. "Dick and I-we were alone. We were... 
and then suddenly it was all around us. I couldn't run. Elena said the tomb had opened. Maybe that was 
where it came from. It was horrible..." 


"They were in the cemetery, in the ruined church," Meredith interpreted. "And Elena was with them. And 
look at this." In the overhead light, they could all see the deep fresh scratches running down Vickie's neck 
to the lace bodice of her slip. 


"They look like animal marks," said Bonnie. "Like the marks of cat's claws, maybe." 


"No cat got that old man under the bridge," said Matt. His face was pale, and muscles stood out in his 
jaw. Meredith followed his gaze down the road and then shook her head. 


"Matt, we have to take her back first. We have to," she said. "Listen to me, I'm as worried about Elena 
as you are. But Vickie needs a doctor, and we need to call the police. We don't have any choice. We 
have to go back." 


Matt stared down the road for another long moment, then let out his breath in a hiss. Slamming the door 
shut, he put the car into gear and turned it around, each motion violent. 


All the way back to town, Vickie moaned about the eyes. 


Page 55 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
Elena felt Stefan's lips meet hers. 
And... it was as simple as that. All questions answered, all fears put to rest, all doubts removed. What 
she felt was not merely passion, but a bruising tenderness and a love so strong it made her shake inside. 


It would have been frightening in its intensity, except that while she was with him, she could not be afraid 
of anything. 
She had come home. 
This was where she belonged, and she had found it at last. With Stefan, she was home. 
He pulled back slightly, and she could feel that he was trembling. 
"Oh, Elena," he whispered against her lips. We can't-
"We already have," she whispered, and drew him back down again. 
It was almost as if she could hear his thoughts, could feel his feelings. Pleasure and desire raced between 


them, connecting them, drawing them closer. And Elena sensed, too, a wellspring of deeper emotions 
within him. He wanted to hold her forever, to protect her from all harm. He wanted to defend her from 
any evil that threatened her. He wanted to join his life with hers. 


She felt the tender pressure of his lips on hers, and she could hardly bear the sweetness of it. Yes, she 


. 
thought. Sensation rippled through her like waves on a still, clear pond. She was drowning in it, both the 
joy she sensed in Stefan and the delicious answering surge in herself. Stefan's love bathed her, shone 
through her, lighting every dark place in her soul like the sun. She trembled with pleasure, with love, and 
with longing.

joy she sensed in Stefan and the delicious answering surge in herself. Stefan's love bathed her, shone 
through her, lighting every dark place in her soul like the sun. She trembled with pleasure, with love, and 
with longing. 


They did not speak. There was no need for words. He stroked her hair, with a touch so light that she 
could scarcely feel it, as if he was afraid she might break in his hands. She knew, then, that it had not 
been hatred that had made him avoid her for so long. No, it had not been hatred at all. 


Elena had no idea how much later it was that they quietly went down the stairs of the boarding house. At 
any other time, she would have been thrilled to get into Stefan's sleek black car, but tonight she scarcely 
noticed it. He held her hand as they drove through the deserted streets. 


The first thing Elena saw as they approached her house was the lights. 


"It's the police," she said, finding her voice with some difficulty. It was odd to talk after being silent so 
long. "And that's Robert's car in the driveway, and there's Matt's," she said. She looked at Stefan, and 
the peace that had filled her suddenly seemed fragile. "I wonder what happened. You don't suppose 
Tyler's already told them... ?" 


Page 56 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
"Even Tyler wouldn't be that stupid," said Stefan. 


He pulled up behind one of the police cars, and reluctantly Elena unclasped her hand from his. She 
wished with all her heart that she and Stefan could just be alone together, that they would never need to 
face the world. 


But there was no help for it. They walked up the pathway to the door, which was open. Inside, the house 
was a blaze of lights. 


Entering, Elena saw what seemed like dozens of faces turned toward her. She had a sudden vision of 
what she must look like, standing there in the doorway in the sweeping black velvet cloak, with Stefan 
Salvatore at her side. And then Aunt Judith gave a cry and was holding her in her arms, shaking her and 
hugging her all at once. 


"Elena! Oh, thank God you're safe. But where have you been? And why didn't you call? Do you realize 
what you've put everyone through?" 


Elena stared around the room in bewilderment. She didn't understand a thing. 


"We're just glad to see you back," said Robert. 


"I've been at the boarding house, with Stefan," she said slowly. "Aunt Judith, this is Stefan Salvatore; he 
rents a room there. He brought me back." 


"Thank you," said Aunt Judith to Stefan over Elena's head. Then, pulling back to look at Elena, she said, 
"But your dress, your hair-what happened?" 


"You don't know? Then Tyler didn't tell you. But then why are the police here?" Elena edged toward 
Stefan instinctively, and she felt him move closer to her in protection. 


. 
"They're here because Vickie Bennett was attacked in the cemetery tonight," said Matt. He and Bonnie 
and Meredith were standing behind Aunt Judith and Robert, looking relieved and a little awkward and 
more than a little tired. "We found her maybe two, three hours ago, and we've been looking for you ever 
since."

" 
"Nobody knows," said Meredith. 
"Well, now, it may be nothing to worry about," said Robert comfortingly. "The doctor said she'd had a 


bad scare, and that she'd been drinking. The whole thing may have been in her imagination." 
"Those scratches weren't imaginary," said Matt, polite but stubborn. 
"What scratches? What are you talking about?" Elena demanded, looking from one face to another. 
"I'll tell you," said Meredith, and she explained, succinctly, how she and the others had found Vickie. 


Page 57 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
"She kept saying she didn't know where you were, that she was alone with Dick when it happened. And 
when we got her back here, the doctor said he couldn't find anything conclusive. She wasn't really hurt 
except for the scratches, and they could have been from a cat." 


"There were no other marks on her?" said Stefan sharply. It was the first time he'd spoken since entering 


the house, and Elena looked at him, surprised by his tone. 
"No," said Meredith. "Of course, a cat didn't tear her clothes off-but Dick might have. Oh, and her 
tongue was bitten." 


"What?" said Elena. 
"Badly bitten, I mean. It must have bled a lot, and it hurts her to talk now." 
Beside Elena, Stefan had gone very still. "Did she have any explanation for what happened?" 
"She was hysterical," Matt said. "Really hysterical; she wasn't making any sense. She kept babbling about 


eyes and dark mist and not being able to run-which is why the doctor thinks maybe it was some sort of 
hallucination. But as far as anyone can make out, the facts are that she and Dick Carter were in the 
ruined church by the cemetery at about midnight, and that something came in and attacked her there." 


Bonnie added, "It didn't attack Dick, which at least shows it had, some taste. The police found him 


passed out on the church floor, and he doesn't remember a thing." 
But Elena scarcely heard the last words. Something had gone terribly wrong with Stefan. She couldn't tell 
how she knew it, but she knew. He had stiffened as Matt finished speaking, and now, though he hadn't 
moved, she felt as if a great distance was separating them, as if she and he were on opposite sides of a 
rifting, cracking floe of ice. 


He said, in the terribly controlled voice she had heard before in his room, "In the church, Matt?" 
"Yes, in the ruined church," Matt said. 
"And you're sure she said it was midnight?" 
"She couldn't be positive, but it must have been sometime around then. We found her not long after. 


Why?" 


. 
Stefan said nothing. Elena could feel the gulf between them widening. "Stefan," she whispered. Then, 
aloud, she said desperately, "Stefan, what is it?"

"The doctor said there was nothing much wrong with her," Matt said. "Nobody's even suggested she

L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
might die." 
Stefan's nod was abrupt; then he turned to Elena. "I've got to go," he said. "You're safe now." 
She caught his hand as he turned away. "Of course I'm safe," she said. "Because of you." 
"Yes," he said. But there was no response in his eyes. They were shielded, dull. 
"Call me tomorrow." She squeezed his hand, trying to convey what she felt under the scrutiny of all those 


watching eyes. She willed him to understand. 
He looked down at their hands with no expression at all, then, slowly, back up at her. And then, at last, 


he returned the pressure of her fingers. "Yes, Elena," he whispered, his eyes clinging to hers. The next 
minute he was gone. 
She took a deep breath and turned back to the crowded room. Aunt Judith was still hovering, her gaze 

fixed on what could be seen of Elena's torn dress underneath the cloak. 
"Elena," she said, "what happened?" And her eyes went to the door through which Stefan had just left. 
A sort of hysterical laughter surged up in Elena's throat, and she choked it back. "Stefan didn't do it," she 


said. "Stefan saved me." She felt her face harden, and she looked at the police officer behind Aunt Judith. 
"It was Tyler, Tyler Smallwood..."

She was not the reincarnation of Katherine. 


Driving back to the boarding house in the faint lavender hush before dawn, Stefan thought about that. 
He'd said as much to her, and it was true, but he was only now realizing how long he'd been working 
toward that conclusion. He'd been aware of Elena's every breath and move for weeks, and he'd 
catalogued every difference. 

Her hair was a shade or two paler than Katherine's, and her eyebrows and lashes were darker. 
Katherine's had been almost silvery. And she was taller than Katherine by a good handspan. She moved 
with greater freedom, too; the girls of this age were more comfortable with their bodies. 

Even her eyes, those eyes that had transfixed him with the shock of recognition that first day, were not 
really the same. Katherine's eyes had usually been wide with childlike wonder, or else cast down as was 
proper for a young girl of the late fifteenth century. But Elena's eyes met you straight on, looked at you 
steadily and without flinching. And sometimes they narrowed with determination or challenge in a way 

. 
Katherine's never had. 
Katherine's never had. 
As he drove past the silhouettes of maple trees, Stefan cringed from the memory that sprang up suddenly. 


Page 59 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
He would not think about that, he would not let himself... but the images were already unreeling before 
him. It was as if the journal had fallen open and he could do no more than stare helplessly at the page 
while the story played itself out in his mind. 

White, Katherine had been wearing white that day. A new white gown of Venetian silk with slashed 
sleeves to show the fine linen chemise underneath. She had a necklace of gold and pearls about her neck 
and tiny pearl drop earrings in her ears. 

She had been so delighted with the new dress her father had commissioned especially for her. 

She had pirouetted in front of Stefan, lifting the full, floor-length skirt in one small hand to show the yellow 
brocaded underskirt beneath... 

"You see, it is even embroidered with my initials. Papa had that done. Mein lieber Papa ..." Her voice 
trailed off, and she stopped twirling, one hand slowly settling to her side. "But what is wrong, Stefan? 
You are not smiling." 

He could not even try. The sight of her there, white and gold like some ethereal vision, was a physical 
pain to him. If he lost her, he did not know how he could live. 

His fingers closed convulsively around the cool engraved metal. "Katherine, how can I smile, how can I 
be happy when..." 

"When?" 

"When I see how you look at Damon." There, it was said. He continued, painfully. "Before he came 
home, you and I were together every day. My father and yours were pleased, and spoke of marriage 
plans. But now the days grow shorter, summer is almost gone-and you spend as much time with 
Damon as you do with me. The only reason Father allows him to stay here is that you asked it. But why 
did you ask it, Katherine? I thought you cared for me." 

Her blue eyes were dismayed. "I do care for you, Stefan. Oh, you know I do!" 

"Then why intercede for Damon with my father? If not for you, he'd have thrown Damon out into the 
street..." 

"Which I'm sure would have pleased you, little brother." The voice at the door was smooth and arrogant, 
but when Stefan turned he saw that Damon's eyes were smoldering. 

"Oh, no, that isn't true," said Katherine. "Stefan would never wish to see you hurt." 

Damon's lip quirked, and he threw Stefan a wry glance as he moved to Katherine's side. "Perhaps not," 
he said to her, his voice softening slightly. "But my brother is right about one thing at least. The days grow 
shorter, and soon your father will be leaving Florence. And he will take you with him-unless you have a 
reason to stay." 


Unless you have a husband to stay with. The words were unspoken, but they all heard them. The 
baron was too fond of his daughter to force her to marry against her will. In the end it would have to be 
Katherine's decision. Katherine's choice.

Unless you have a husband to stay with. The words were unspoken, but they all heard them. The 
baron was too fond of his daughter to force her to marry against her will. In the end it would have to be 
Katherine's decision. Katherine's choice. 

"Ah, yes, before the old man grows suspicious," Damon said casually. "Even the most doting of fathers 
must start to wonder when his daughter comes forth only at night." 

Anger and hurt swept through Stefan. It was true, then; Damon knew. Katherine had shared her secret 
with his brother. 

"Why did you tell him, Katherine? Why? What can you see in him: a man who cares for nothing but his 
own pleasure? How can he make you happy when he thinks only of himself?" 

"And how can this boy make you happy when he knows nothing of the world?" Damon interposed, his 
voice razor-sharp with contempt. "How will he protect you when he has never faced reality? He has 
spent his life among books and paintings; let him stay there." 

Katherine was shaking her head in distress, her jewel-blue eyes misted with tears. 

"Neither of you understand," she said. "You are thinking that I can marry and settle here like any other 
lady of Florence. But I cannot be like other ladies. How could I keep a household of servants who will 
watch my every move? How could I live in one place where the people will see that the years do not 
touch me? There will never be a normal life for me." 

She drew a deep breath and looked at them each in turn. "Who chooses to be my husband must give up 
the life of sunlight," she whispered. "He must choose to live under the moon and in the hours of 
darkness." 

"Then you must choose someone who is not afraid of shadows," Damon said, and Stefan was surprised 
by the intensity of his voice. He had never heard Damon speak so earnestly or with so little affectation. 
"Katherine, look at my brother: will he be able to renounce the sunlight? He is too attached to ordinary 
things: his friends, his family, his duty to Florence. The darkness would destroy him." 

"Liar!" cried Stefan. He was seething now. "I am as strong as you are, brother, and I fear nothing in the 
shadows or the sunlight either. And I love Katherine more than friends or family-" 

"-or your duty? Do you love her enough to give that up as well?" 

"Yes," Stefan said defiantly. "Enough to give up everything." 

Damon gave one of his sudden, disturbing smiles. Then he turned back to Katherine. "It would seem," he 
said, "that the choice is yours alone. You have two suitors for your hand; will you take one of us or 
neither?" 

Katherine slowly bowed her golden head. Then she lifted wet blue eyes to both of them. 

"Give me until Sunday to think. And in the meantime, do not press me with questions." 

Stefan nodded reluctantly. Damon said, "And on Sunday?" 

"Sunday evening at twilight I will make my choice."

. 
Twilight... the violet deep darkness of twilight... 


Twilight... the violet deep darkness of twilight... 


To the northwest he could see Wickery Bridge and the graveyard. New memory set his pulse pounding. 


He had told Damon he was willing to give up everything for Katherine. And that was just what he had 
done. He had renounced all claim to the sunlight, and had become a creature of darkness for her. A 
hunter doomed to be forever hunted himself, a thief who had to steal life to fill his own veins. 


And perhaps a murderer. No, they had said the girl Vickie would not die. But his next victim might. The 
worst thing about this last attack was that he remembered nothing of it. He remembered the weakness, 
the overpowering need, and he remembered staggering through the church door, but nothing after. He'd 
come to his senses outside with Elena's scream echoing in his ears-and he had raced to her without 
stopping to think about what might have happened. 


Elena... For a moment he felt a rush of pure joy and awe, forgetting everything else. Elena, warm as 
sunlight, soft as morning, but with a core of steel that could not be broken. She was like fire burning in 
ice, like the keen edge of a silver dagger. 


But did he have the right to love her? His very feeling for her put her in danger. What if the next time the 
need took him Elena was the nearest living human, the nearest vessel filled with warm, renewing blood? 


I will die before touching her, he thought, making a vow of it. Before I broach her veins, I will die of 
thirst. And I swear she will never know ray secret. She will never have to give up the sunlight because of 
me. 


Behind him, the sky was lightening. But before he left, he sent out one probing thought, with all the force 
of his pain behind it, seeking for some other Power that might be near. Searching for some other solution 
to what had happened in the church. 


But there was nothing, no hint of an answer. The graveyard mocked him with silence. 


Elena woke with the sun shining in her window. She felt, at once, as if she'd just recovered from a long 
bout of the flu, and as if it were Christmas morning. Her thoughts jumbled together as she sat up. 


Oh. She hurt all over. But she and Stefan-that made everything right. That drunken slob Tyler... But 
Tyler didn't matter anymore. Nothing mattered except that Stefan loved her. 


She went downstairs in her nightgown, realizing from the light slanting in the windows that she must have 
slept in very late. Aunt Judith and Margaret were in the living room. 


"Good morning, Aunt Judith." She gave her surprised aunt a long, hard hug. "And good morning, 
pumpkin." She swept Margaret off her feet and waltzed around the room with her. "And-oh! Good 
morning, Robert." A little embarrassed at her exuberance and her state of undress, she put Margaret 
down and hurried into the kitchen. 


Aunt Judith came in. Though there were dark circles under her eyes, she was smiling. "You seem in good 
spirits this morning." 


Page 62 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
. 
"Oh, I am." Elena gave her another hug, to apologize for the dark circles. 
"You know we have to go back to the sheriff's to talk to them about Tyler." 
"Yes." Elena got juice out of the refrigerator and poured herself a glass. "But can I go over to Vickie 


Bennett's house first? I know she must be upset, especially since it sounds like not everybody believes 
her." 


"Do you believe her, Elena?" 
"Yes," she said slowly, "I do believe her. And, Aunt Judith," she added, coming to a decision, "something 
happened to me in the church, too. I thought-" 


"Elena! Bonnie and Meredith are here to see you." Robert's voice sounded from the hallway. 


The mood of confidence was broken. "Oh... send them in," Elena called, and took a sip of orange juice. 
"I'll tell you about it later," she promised Aunt Judith, as footsteps approached the kitchen. 
Bonnie and Meredith stopped in the doorway, standing with unaccustomed formality. 
Elena herself felt awkward, and waited until her aunt left the room again to speak. 
Then she cleared her throat, her eyes fixed on a worn tile in the linoleum. She sneaked a quick glance up 


and saw that both Bonnie and Meredith were staring at that same tile. 
She burst into laughter, and at the sound they both looked up. 
"I'm too happy to even be defensive," Elena said, holding out her arms to them. "And I know I ought to 


be sorry about what I said, and I am sorry, but I just can't be all pathetic about it. I was terrible and I 


deserve to be executed, and now can we just pretend it never happened?" 
"You ought to be sorry, running off on us like that," Bonnie scolded as the three of them joined in a 
tangled embrace. 


"And with Tyler Smallwood, of all people," said Meredith. 


"Well, I learned my lesson on that score," Elena said, and for a moment her mood darkened. Then 
Bonnie trilled laughter. 
"And you scored the big one yourself-Stefan Salvatore! Talk about dramatic entrances. When you 


came in the door with him, I thought I was hallucinating. How did you do it?" 
"I didn't. He just showed up, like the cavalry in one of those old movies." 
"Defending your honor," said Bonnie. "What could be more thrilling?" 
"I can think of one or two things," said Meredith. "But then, maybe Elena's got those covered, too." 


Page 63 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
"I'll tell you all about it," Elena said, releasing them and stepping back. "But first will you come over to 


Vickie's house with me? I want to talk to her." 
"You can talk to us while you're dressing, and while we're walking, and while you're brushing your teeth 
for that matter," said Bonnie firmly. "And if you leave out one tiny detail, you're going to be facing the 
Spanish Inquisition." 


. 
"You see," said Meredith archly, "all Mr. Tanner's work has paid off. Bonnie now knows the Spanish 
Inquisition is not a rock group." 


Elena was laughing with sheer ebullience as they went up the stairs. 


Mrs. Bennett looked pale and tired, but invited them in. 


"Vickie's been resting; the doctor said to keep her in bed," she explained, with a smile that trembled 
slightly. Elena, Bonnie, and Meredith crowded into the narrow hallway. 
Mrs. Bennett tapped lightly at Vickie's door. "Vickie, sweetheart, some girls from school to see you. 


Don't keep her long," she added to Elena, opening the door. 
"We won't," Elena promised. She stepped into a pretty blue-and-white bedroom, the others right behind 


her. Vickie was lying in bed propped up on pillows, with a powder-blue comforter drawn up to her chin. 
Her face was paper-white against it, and her heavy-lidded eyes stared straight ahead. 
"That's how she looked last night," Bonnie whispered. 
Elena moved to the side of the bed. "Vickie," she said softly. Vickie went on staring, but Elena thought 


her breathing changed slightly. "Vickie, can you hear me? It's Elena Gilbert." She glanced uncertainly at 
Bonnie and Meredith. 


"Looks like they gave her tranquilizers," said Meredith. 
But Mrs. Bennett hadn't said they'd given her any drugs. Frowning, Elena turned back to the 
unresponsive girl. 


"Vickie, it's me, Elena. I just wanted to talk to you about last night. I want you to know that I believe you 
about what happened." Elena ignored the sharp glance Meredith gave her and continued. "And I wanted 
to ask you-" 


"No!" It was a shriek, raw and piercing, torn from Vickie's throat. The body that had been as still as a 
wax figure exploded into violent action. Vickie's light-brown hair whipped across her cheeks as she 


Page 64 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
tossed her head back and forth and her hands flailed at the empty air. "No! No!" she screamed. 


"Do something!" Bonnie gasped. "Mrs. Bennett! Mrs. Bennett!" 
Elena and Meredith were trying to hold Vickie on the bed, and she was fighting them. The shrieking went 


on and on. Then suddenly Vickie's mother was beside them, helping to hold her, pushing the others 
away. 
"What did you do to her?" she cried. 
Vickie clutched at her mother, calming down, but then the heavy-lidded eyes glimpsed Elena over Mrs. 


Bennett's shoulder. 
"You're part of it! You're evil!" she screamed hysterically at Elena. "Keep away from me!" 
Elena was dumbfounded. "Vickie! I only came to ask-" 
"I think you'd better leave now. Leave us alone," said Mrs. Bennett, clasping her daughter protectively. 


"Can't you see what you're doing to her?" 


. 
In stunned silence, Elena left the room. Bonnie and Meredith followed. 


In stunned silence, Elena left the room. Bonnie and Meredith followed. 


"Did you notice her hands?" Meredith said to Elena. "When we were trying to restrain her, I got hold of 
one of her hands. And it was cold as ice." 


Elena shook her head in bewilderment. None of it made sense, but she wouldn't let it spoil her day. She 
wouldn't. Desperately, she searched her mind for something that would offset the experience, that would 
allow her to hold on to her happiness. 


"I know," she said. "The boarding house." 


"What?" 


"I told Stefan to call me today, but why don't we walk over to the boarding house instead? It's not far 
from here." 


"Only a twenty-minute walk," said Bonnie. She brightened. "At least we can finally see that room of his." 


"Actually," said Elena, "I was thinking you two could wait downstairs. Well, I'll only get to see him for a 
few minutes," she added, defensively, as they looked at her. It was odd, perhaps, but she didn't want to 
share Stefan with her friends just yet. He was so new to her that he felt almost like a secret. 


Their knock on the shining oak door was answered by Mrs. Flowers. She was a wrinkled little gnome of 
a woman with surprisingly bright black eyes. 


"You must be Elena," she said. "I saw you and Stefan go out last night, and he told me your name when 


Page 65 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
he came back." 

"You saw us?" said Elena, startled. "I didn't see you." 

"No, no you didn't," said Mrs. Flowers, and chuckled. "What a pretty girl you are, my dear," she added. 
"A very pretty girl." She patted Elena's cheek. 


"Uh, thank you," said Elena uneasily. She didn't like the way those birdlike eyes were fixed on her. She 
looked past Mrs. Flowers to the stairs. "Is Stefan home?" 


"He must be, unless he's flown off the roof!" said Mrs. Flowers, and chuckled again. Elena laughed 
politely. 


"We'll stay down here with Mrs. Flowers," said Meredith to Elena, while Bonnie rolled her eyes in 
martyrdom. Hiding a grin, Elena nodded and mounted the stairs. 


Such a strange old house, she thought again as she located the second stairway in the bedroom. The 
voices below were very faint from here, and as she went up the steps they faded entirely. She was 
wrapped in silence, and as she reached the dimly lit door at the top, she had the feeling she had entered 
some other world. Her knocking sounded very timid. "Stefan?" She could hear nothing from inside, but 
suddenly the door swung open. Everyone must look pale and tired today, thought Elena, and then she 
was in his arms. 


Those arms tightened about her convulsively. "Elena. Oh, Elena..." 


Then he drew back. It was just the way it had been last night; Elena could feel the chasm opening 
between them. She saw the cold, correct look gather in his eyes. 


. 
"No," she said, hardly aware that she spoke aloud. "I won't let you." And she pulled his mouth down to 


hers. 
For a moment there was no response, and then he shuddered, and the kiss became searing. His fingers 
tangled in her hair, and the universe shrank around Elena. Nothing else existed but Stefan, and the feel of 
his arms around her, and the fire of his lips on hers. 


A few minutes or a few centuries later they separated, both shaking. But their gaze remained connected, 
and Elena saw that Stefan's eyes were too dilated for even this dim light; there was only a thin band of 
green around the dark pupils. He looked dazed, and his mouth-that mouth!-was swollen. 


"I think," he said, and she could hear the control in his voice, "that we had better be careful when we do 


that." 
Elena nodded, dazed herself. Not in public, she was thinking. And not when Bonnie and Meredith were 
waiting downstairs. And not when they were absolutely alone, unless... 


Page 66 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
"But you can just hold me," she said. 

How odd, that after that passion she could feel so safe, so peaceful, in his arms. "I love you," she 
whispered into the rough wool of his sweater. 
She felt a quiver go through him. "Elena," he said again, and it was a sound almost of despair. 
She raised her head. "What's wrong with that? What could possibly be wrong with that, Stefan? Don't 


you love me?" 


"I..." He looked at her, helplessly-and they heard Mrs. Flowers's voice calling faintly from the bottom 
of the stairs. 
"Boy! Boy! Stefan!" It sounded as if she were pounding on the banister with her shoe. 
Stefan sighed. "I'd better go see what she wants." He slipped away from her, his face unreadable. 
Left alone, Elena folded her arms across her chest and shivered. It was so cold here. He ought to have a 


fire, she thought, eyes moving idly around the room to rest finally on the mahogany dresser she'd 
examined last night. 


The coffer. 
She glanced at the closed door. If he came back in and caught her... She really shouldn't-but she was 
already moving toward the dresser. 


Think of Bluebeard's wife, she told herself. Curiosity killed her. But her fingers were on the iron lid. Her 


heart beating rapidly, she eased the lid open. 
In the dim light, the coffer appeared at first to be empty, and Elena gave a nervous laugh. What had she 
expected? Love letters from Caroline? A bloody dagger? 


Then she saw the thin strip of silk, folded over and over on itself neatly in one corner. She drew it out and 
ran it between her fingers. It was the apricot ribbon she'd lost the second day of school. 
Oh, Stefan. Tears stung her eyes, and in her chest love welled up helplessly, overflowing. 
That long ago? You cared about me that long ago? Oh, Stefan, I love you... 


. 
And it doesn't matter if you can't say it to me, she thought. There was a sound outside the door, and she 
folded the ribbon quickly and replaced it in the coffer. Then she turned toward the door, blinking tears 
from her eyes. 


And it doesn't matter if you can't say it to me, she thought. There was a sound outside the door, and she

Chapter Ten 

&laquo; ^ &raquo; 

October 7, about 8:00 a.m. 

Dear Diary, 

I'm writing this during trig class, and I just hope Ms. Halpern doesn't see me. 

I didn't have time to write last night, even though I wanted to. Yesterday was a crazy, mixed-up 
day, just like the night of the Homecoming Dance. Sitting here in school this morning I almost feel 
like everything that happened this weekend was a dream. The bad things were so bad, but the 
good things were so very, very good. 

I'm not going to press criminal charges against Tyler. He's suspended from school, though, and off 
the football team. So's Dick, for being drunk at the dance. Nobody is saying so, but I think a lot of 
people think he was responsible for what happened to Vickie. Bonnie's sister saw Tyler at the 
clinic yesterday, and she said he had two black eyes and his whole face was purple. I can't help 
worrying about what's going to happen when he and Dick get back to school. They have more 
reason than ever to hate Stefan now. 

Which brings me to Stefan. When I woke up this morning I panicked, thinking, "What if it all isn't 
true? What if it never happened, or if he's changed his mind?" And Aunt Judith was worried at 
breakfast because I couldn't eat again. But then when I got to school I saw him in the corridor by 
the office, and we just looked at each other. And I knew. Just before he turned away, he smiled, 
sort of wryly. And I understood that, too, and he was right, it was better not to go up to each 
other in a public hallway, not unless we want to give the secretaries a thrill. 

We are very definitely together. Now I just have to find a way to explain all this to Jean-Claude. 
Ha-ha. 

What I don't understand is why Stefan isn't as happy about it as I am. When we're with each other 
I can feel how he feels, and I know how much he wants me, how much he cares. There's an almost 
desperate hunger inside him when he kisses me, as if he wants to pull the soul out of my body. 
Like a black hole that. 

Still October 7, now about 2:00 prev.m.

Will, a little break there because Miss Halpern caught me. She even started to read what I'd 
written out loud, but then I think the subject matter steamed her glasses up and she stopped. She 
was Not Amused. I'm too happy to care about minor things like flunking trigonometry. 


Stefan and I had lunch together, or at least we went off into a corner of the field and sat down 
with my lunch. He didn't even bother to bring anything, and of course as it turned out I couldn't 
eat either. We didn't touch each other much-we didn't-but we talked and looked at each other a 
lot. I want to touch him. More than any boy I've ever known. And I know he wants it, too, but he's 
holding back on me. That's what I can't understand, why he's fighting this, why he's holding back. 
Yesterday in his room I found proof positive that he's been watching me from the beginning. You 
remember how I told you that on the second day of school Bonnie and Meredith and I were in the 

Page 68 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
cemetery? Well, yesterday in Stefan's room I found the apricot ribbon I was wearing that day. I 
remember it falling out of my hand while I was running, and he must have picked it up and kept it. 
I haven't told him I know, because he obviously wants to keep it a secret, but that shows, doesn't 
it, that he cares about me?

I wonder why Stefan hasn't been eating lunch, though. It's strange in a football player. 

Uh-oh. Mr. Tanner just walked by and I slammed my note pad over this diary just in time. Bonnie 
is snickering behind her history book, I can see her shoulders shaking. And Stefan, who's in front 
of me, looks as tense as if he's going to leap out of his chair any minute. Matt is giving me "you 
nut" looks and Caroline is glaring. I am being very, very innocent, writing with my eyes fixed on 
Tanner up front. So if this is a bit wobbly and messy, you'll understand why. 

For the last month, I haven't really been myself. I haven't been able to think clearly or concentrate 
on anything but Stefan. There is so much I've left undone that I'm almost scared. I'm supposed to 
be in charge of decorations for the Haunted House and I haven't done one thing about it yet Now 
I've got exactly three and a half weeks to get it organized-and I want to be with Stefan. 

I could quit the committee. But that would leave Bonnie and Meredith holding the bag. And I keep 
remembering what Matt said when I asked him to get Stefan to come to the dance: "You want 
everybody and everything revolving around Elena Gilbert." 

That isn't true. Or at least, if it has been in the past, I'm not going to let it be true anymore. I want 
-oh, this is going to sound completely stupid, but I want to be worthy of Stefan. I know he 
wouldn't let the guys on the team down just to suit his own convenience. I want him to be proud of 
me. 

I want him to love me as much as I love him. 

"Hurry up!" called Bonnie from the doorway of the gym. Beside her the high school janitor, Mr. Shelby, 
stood waiting. 

Elena cast one last glance at the distant figures on the football field, then reluctantly crossed the blacktop 
to join Bonnie. 


"I just wanted to tell Stefan where I was going," she said. After a week of being with Stefan, she still felt a 
thrill of excitement just saying his name. Every night this week he'd come to her house, appearing at the 
door around sunset, hands in pockets, wearing his jacket with the collar turned up. They usually took a 

Page 69 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
walk in the dusk, or sat on the porch, talking. Although nothing was said about it, Elena knew it was 
Stefan's way of making sure they weren't alone together in private. Since the night of the dance, he'd 
made sure of that. Protecting her honor, Elena thought wryly, and with a pang, because she knew in her 
heart that there was more to it than that.

"Hello, Mr. Shelby," said Elena to the janitor, who was still patiently waiting. To her surprise, he closed 
one eye in a solemn wink at her. "Where's Meredith?" she added. 

"Here," said a voice behind her, and Meredith appeared with a cardboard box of file folders and note 
pads in her arms. "I've got the stuff from your locker." 

"Is that all of you?" said Mr. Shelby. "All right, now, you gals leave the door shut and locked, you hear? 
That way nobody can get in." 

Bonnie, about to enter, pulled up short. 

"You're sure there's nobody already in?" she said warily. 

Elena gave her a push between the shoulder blades. "Hurry up," she mimicked unkindly. "I want to get 
home in time for dinner." 

"There's nobody inside," said Mr. Shelby, mouth twitching under his mustache. "But you gals yell if you 
want anything. I'll be around." 

The door slammed shut behind them with a curiously final sound. 

"Work," said Meredith resignedly, and put the box on the floor. 

Elena nodded, looking up and down the big empty room. Every year the Student Council held a Haunted 
House as a fund-raiser. Elena had been on the decorating committee for the last two years, along with 
Bonnie and Meredith, but it was different being chairman. She had to make decisions that would affect 
everyone, and she couldn't even rely on what had been done in years past. 

The Haunted House was usually set up in a lumberyard warehouse, but with the growing uneasiness 
about town it had been decided that the school gym was safer. For Elena, it meant rethinking the whole 
interior design, and with less than three weeks now until Halloween. 

"It's actually pretty spooky here," said Meredith quietly. And there was something disturbing about being 
in the big closed room, Elena thought. She found herself lowering her voice. 

"Let's measure it first," she said. They moved down the room, their footsteps echoing hollowly. 

"All right," said Elena when they had finished. "Let's get to work." She tried to shake off her feeling of 

Page 70 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
uneasiness, telling herself that it was ridiculous to feel unsettled in the school gym, with Bonnie and 
Meredith beside her and an entire football team practicing not two hundred yards away. 

The three of them sat on the bleachers with pens and notebooks in hand. Elena and Meredith consulted 
the design sketches for previous years while Bonnie bit her pen and gazed around thoughtfully. 


"Well, here's the gym," said Meredith, making a quick sketch in her notebook. "And here's where the 
people are going to have to come in. Now we could have the Bloody Corpse at the very end... By the 
way, who's going to be the Bloody Corpse this year?" 

"Well, here's the gym," said Meredith, making a quick sketch in her notebook. "And here's where the 
people are going to have to come in. Now we could have the Bloody Corpse at the very end... By the 
way, who's going to be the Bloody Corpse this year?" 

"I think we should have druids," said Bonnie abruptly. 

"Have what?" said Elena, and then, as Bonnie started to yell "droo-ids," she waved a quelling hand. "All 
right, all right, I remember. But why?" 

"Because they're the ones who invented Halloween. Really. It started out as one of their holy days, when 
they would build fires and put out turnips with faces carved in them to keep evil spirits away. They 
believed it was the day when the line between the living and the dead was thinnest. And they were scary, 
Elena. They performed human sacrifices. We could sacrifice Coach Lyman." 

"Actually, that's not a bad idea," said Meredith. "The Bloody Corpse could be a sacrifice. You know, on 
a stone altar, with a knife and pools of blood all around. And then when you get really close, he suddenly 
sits up." 

"And gives you heart failure," said Elena, but she had to admit it was a good idea, definitely scary. It 
made her feel a little sick just thinking about it. All that blood... but it was only Karo syrup, really. 

The other girls had gone quiet, too. From the boys' locker next door, they could hear the sound of water 
running and lockers banging, and over that indistinct voices shouting. 

"Practice is over," murmured Bonnie. "It must be dark outside." 

"Yes, and Our Hero is getting all washed up," said Meredith, cocking an eyebrow at Elena. "Want to 
peek?" 

"I wish," said Elena, only half jokingly. Somehow, indefinably, the atmosphere in the room had darkened. 
Just at the moment she did wish she could see Stefan, could be with him. 

"Have you heard anything more about Vickie Bennett?" she asked suddenly. 

"Well," said Bonnie after a moment, "I did hear that her parents were getting her a psychiatrist." 

"A shrink? Why?" 

"Well... I guess they think that those things she told us were hallucinations or something. And I heard her 
nightmares are pretty bad." 

Page 71 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
"Oh," said Elena. The sounds from the boys' locker room were fading, and they heard an outside door 
slam. Hallucinations, she thought, hallucinations and nightmares. For some reason, she suddenly 
remembered that night in the graveyard, that night when Bonnie had sent them all running from something 
none of them could see. 


"We'd better get back to business," said Meredith. Elena shook herself out of her reverie and nodded. 


"We... we could have a graveyard," Bonnie said tentatively, as if she'd been reading Elena's thoughts. "In 
the Haunted House, I mean." 


. 
"No," said Elena sharply. "No, we'll just stick with what we have," she added in a calmer voice, and bent 
over her pad again. 


Once again there was no sound but the soft scratching of pens and the rustle of paper. 
"Good," said Elena at last. "Now we only need to measure for the different partitions. Somebody's going 
to have to get in behind the bleachers... What now?" 


The lights in the gym had flickered and gone down to half power. 


"Oh, no," said Meredith, exasperated. The lights flickered again, went out, and returned dimly once 
more. 
"I can't read a thing," said Elena, staring at what now seemed to be a featureless piece of white paper. 


She looked up at Bonnie and Meredith and saw two white blobs of faces. 
"Something must be wrong with the emergency generator," said Meredith. "I'll get Mr. Shelby." 
"Can't we just finish tomorrow?" Bonnie said plaintively. 
"Tomorrow's Saturday," said Elena. "And we were supposed to have this done last week." 
"I'll get Shelby," said Meredith again. "Come on, Bonnie, you're going with me." 
Elena began, "We could all go-" but Meredith interrupted. 
"If we all go and we can't find him, then we can't get back in. Come on, Bonnie, it's only inside the 


school." 
"But it's dark there." 
"It's dark everywhere; it's nighttime. Come on; with two of us it'll be safe." She dragged an unwilling 


Bonnie to the door. "Elena, don't let anybody else in." 
"As if you had to tell me," said Elena, letting them out and then watching them go a few paces down the 


hall. At the point at which they began to merge with the dimness, she stepped back inside and shut the 
door. 
Well, this was a fine mess, as her mother used to say. Elena moved over to the cardboard box Meredith 


Page 72 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
had brought and began stacking filing folders and notebooks back inside it. In this light she could see 
them only as vague shapes. There was no sound at all but her own breathing and the sounds she made. 
She was alone in the huge, dim room-


Someone was watching her. 
She didn't know how she knew, but she was sure. Someone was behind her in the dark gymnasium, 


watching. Eyes in the dark, the old man had said. Vickie had said it, too. And now there were eyes on 
her. 
She whirled quickly to face the room, straining her own eyes to see into the shadows, trying not even to 


breathe. She was terrified that if she made a sound the thing out there would get her. But she could see 


nothing, hear nothing. 
The bleachers were dim, menacing shapes stretching out into nothingness. And the far end of the room 
was simply a featureless gray fog. Dark mist, she thought, and she could feel every muscle agonizingly 


. 
tense as she listened desperately. Oh God, what was that soft whispering sound? It must be her 
imagination... Please let it be her imagination. 


tense as she listened desperately. Oh God, what was that soft whispering sound? It must be her 
imagination... Please let it be her imagination. 


Something moved in the shadows. 


Her scream froze in her throat. Her muscles were frozen, too, held motionless by her terror-and by 
some nameless force. Helplessly, she watched as the shape in the darkness moved out of the shadows 
and toward her. It seemed almost as if the darkness itself had come to life and was coalescing as she 
watched, taking on form-human form, the form of a young man. 


"I'm sorry if I frightened you." 


The voice was pleasant, with a slight accent she couldn't place. It didn't sound sorry at all. 


Relief was so sudden and complete that it was painful. She slumped and heard her own breath sigh out. 


It was only a guy, some former student or an assistant of Mr. Shelby's. An ordinary guy, who was smiling 
faintly, as if it had amused him to see her almost pass out. 


Well... perhaps not quite ordinary. He was remarkably good-looking. His face was pale in the artificial 
twilight, but she could see that his features were cleanly defined and nearly perfect under a shock of dark 
hair. Those cheekbones were a sculptor's dream. And he'd been almost invisible because he was wearing 
black: soft black boots, black jeans, black sweater, and leather jacket. 


Page 73 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
He was still smiling faintly. Elena's relief turned to anger. 

"How did you get in?" she demanded. "And what are you doing here? Nobody else is supposed to be in 
the gym." 
"I came in the door," he said. His voice was soft, cultured, but she could still hear the amusement and she 

found it disconcerting. 
"All the doors are locked," she said flatly, accusingly. 
He raised his eyebrows and smiled. "Are they?" 
Elena felt another quiver of fear, hairs lifting on the back of her neck. "They were supposed to be," she 


said in the coldest voice she could manage. 
"You're angry," he said gravely. "I said I was sorry to frighten you." 
"I wasn't frightened!" she snapped. She felt foolish in front of him somehow, like a child being humored 


by someone much older and more knowledgeable. It made her even angrier. "I was just startled," she 


continued. "Which is hardly surprising, what with you lurking in the dark like that." 
"Interesting things happen in the dark... sometimes." He was still laughing at her; she could tell by his 
eyes. He had taken a step closer, and she could see that those eyes were unusual, almost black, but with 
odd lights in them. As if you could look deeper and deeper until you fell into them, and went on falling 
forever. 

She realized she was staring. Why didn't the lights come on? She wanted to get out of here. She moved 

away, putting the end of a bleacher between them, and stacked the last folders into the box. Forget the 

rest of the work for tonight. All she wanted to do now was leave. 

rest of the work for tonight. All she wanted to do now was leave. 
"Did you come looking for somebody?" She was annoyed with herself for being the one to speak. 
He was still gazing at her, those dark eyes fixed on her in a way that made her more and more 


uncomfortable. She swallowed. 
With his eyes on her lips, he murmured, "Oh, yes." 
"What?" She'd forgotten what she'd asked. Her cheeks and throat were flushing, burning with blood. She 


felt so light-headed. If only he'd stop looking at her... 


"Yes, I came here looking for someone," he repeated, no louder than before. Then, in one step he moved 
toward her, so that they were separated only by the corner of one bleacher seat. 
Elena couldn't breathe. He was standing so close. Close enough to touch. She could smell a faint hint of 

cologne and the leather of his jacket. And his eyes still held hers-she could not look away from them. 
They were like no eyes she had ever seen, black as midnight, the pupils dilated like a cat's. They filled her 
vision as he leaned toward her, bending his head down to hers. She felt her own eyes half close, losing 

Page 74 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
focus. She felt her head tilt back, her lips part. 

No! Just in time she whipped her head to the side. She felt as if she'd just pulled herself back from the 
edge of a precipice. What am I doing? she thought in shock. I was about to let him kiss me. A total 
stranger, someone I met only a few minutes ago. 

But that wasn't the worst thing. For those few minutes, something unbelievable had happened. For those 
few minutes, she had forgotten Stefan. 

But now his image filled her mind, and the longing for him was like a physical pain in her body. She 
wanted Stefan, wanted his arms around her, wanted to be safe with him. 

She swallowed. Her nostrils flared as she breathed hard. She tried to keep her voice steady and 
dignified. 

"I'm going to leave now," she said. "If you're looking for somebody, I think you'd better look somewhere 
else." 

He was looking at her oddly, with an expression she couldn't understand. It was a mixture of annoyance 
and grudging respect-and something else. Something hot and fierce that frightened her in a different 
way. 

He waited until her hand was on the doorknob to answer, and his voice was soft but serious, with no 
trace of amusement. "Perhaps I've already found her... Elena." 

When she turned, she could see nothing in the darkness. 

Chapter Eleven 

&laquo; ^ &raquo; 


Elena stumbled down the dim corridor, trying to visualize what was around her. Then the world suddenly 
flickered to brightness and she found herself surrounded by familiar rows of lockers. Her relief was so 
great that she almost cried out. She'd never have thought she would be so glad just to see. She stood for 
a minute looking around gratefully.

great that she almost cried out. She'd never have thought she would be so glad just to see. She stood for 
a minute looking around gratefully. 

It was Meredith and Bonnie, hurrying down the hall toward her. 

"Where have you been?" she said fiercely. 

Meredith grimaced. "We couldn't find Shelby. And when we finally did find him, he was asleep. I'm 
serious," she added at Elena's incredulous look. "Asleep. And then we couldn't get him to wake up. It 
wasn't until the lights went back on that he opened his eyes. Then we started back to you. But what are 
you doing here?" 

Page 75 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
Elena hesitated. "I got tired of waiting," she said as lightly as she could. "I think we've done enough work 
for one day, anyway." 

"Now you tell us," said Bonnie. 

Meredith said nothing, but she gave Elena a keen, searching look. Elena had the uncomfortable feeling 
that those dark eyes saw beneath the surface. 

All that weekend and throughout the following week, Elena worked on plans for the Haunted House. 
There was never enough time to be with Stefan, and that was frustrating, but even more frustrating was 
Stefan himself. She could sense his passion for her, but she could also sense that he was fighting it, still 
refusing to be completely alone with her. And in many ways he was just as much a mystery to her as he 
had been when she first saw him. 

He never spoke about his family or his life before coming to Fell's Church, and if she asked any questions 
he turned them aside. Once she had asked him if he missed Italy, if he was sorry he'd come here. And for 
an instant his eyes had lightened, the green sparkling like oak leaves reflected in a running stream. "How 
could I be sorry, when you are here?" he said, and kissed her in a way that put all inquiries out of her 
mind. In that moment, Elena had known what it was like to be completely happy. She'd felt his joy, too, 
and when he pulled back she had seen that his face was alight, as if the sun shone through it. 

"Oh, Elena," he'd whispered. 

The good times were like that. But he had kissed her less and less frequently of late, and she felt the 
distance between them widening. 

That Friday, she and Bonnie and Meredith decided to sleep over at the McCulloughs'. The sky was gray 
and threatening to drizzle as she and Meredith walked to Bonnie's house. It was unusually chilly for 
mid-October, and the trees lining the quiet street had already felt the nip of cold winds. The maples were 
a blaze of scarlet, while the ginkgoes were radiant yellow. 

Bonnie greeted them at the door with: "Everybody's gone! We'll have the whole house to ourselves until 
tomorrow afternoon, when my family gets back from Leesburg." She beckoned them inside, grabbing for 
the overfed Pekingese that was trying to get out. "No, Yangtze, stay in. Yangtze, no, don't! No!" 


But it was too late. Yangtze had escaped and was dashing through the front yard up to the single birch 
tree, where he yapped shrilly up into the branches, rolls of fat on his back jiggling. 

But it was too late. Yangtze had escaped and was dashing through the front yard up to the single birch 
tree, where he yapped shrilly up into the branches, rolls of fat on his back jiggling. 

"It looks like a crow," said Meredith. 

Elena stiffened. She took a few steps toward the tree, looking up into the golden leaves. And there it 
was. The same crow she had seen twice before. Perhaps three times before, she thought, remembering 
the dark shape winging up from the oak trees in the cemetery. 

As she looked at it she felt her stomach clench in fear and her hands grow cold. It was staring at her 
again with its bright black eye, an almost human stare. That eye... where had she seen an eye like that 
before? 

Page 76 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
Suddenly all three girls jumped back as the crow gave a harsh croak and thrashed its wings, bursting out 
of the tree toward them. At the last moment it swooped down instead on the little dog, which was now 
barking hysterically. It came within inches of canine teeth and then soared back up again, flying over the 
house to disappear into the black walnut trees beyond. 


The three girls stood frozen in astonishment. Then Bonnie and Meredith looked at each other, and the 
tension shattered in nervous laughter. 


"For a moment I thought he was coming for us," said Bonnie, going over to the outraged Pekingese and 
dragging him, still barking, back into the house. 


"So did I," said Elena quietly. And as she followed her friends inside, she did not join in the laughter. 


Once she and Meredith had put their things away, however, the evening fell into a familiar pattern. It was 
hard to keep hold of her uneasiness sitting in Bonnie's cluttered living room beside a roaring fire, with a 
cup of hot chocolate in her hand. Soon the three of them were discussing the final plans for the Haunted 
House, and she relaxed. 


"We're in pretty good shape," said Meredith at last. "Of course, we've spent so much time figuring out 
everyone else's costumes that we haven't even thought about our own." 


"Mine's easy," said Bonnie. "I'm going to be a druid priestess, and I only need a garland of oak leaves in 
my hair and some white robes. Mary and I can sew it in one night." 


"I think I'll be a witch," said Meredith thoughtfully. "All that takes is a long black dress. What about you, 
Elena?" 


Elena smiled. "Well, it was supposed to be a secret, but... Aunt Judith let me go to a dressmaker. I 
found a picture of a Renaissance gown in one of the books I used for my oral report, and we're having it 
copied. It's Venetian silk, ice blue, and it's absolutely beautiful." 


"It sounds beautiful," Bonnie said. "And expensive." 


"I'm using my own money from my parents' trust. I just hope Stefan likes it. It's a surprise for him, and... 
well, I just hope he likes it." 


"What's Stefan going to be? Is he helping with the Haunted House?" said Bonnie curiously. 


"I don't know," Elena said after a moment. "He doesn't seem too thrilled with the whole Halloween thing." 


. 
"It's hard to see him all wrapped up in torn sheets and covered with fake blood like the other guys," 


agreed Meredith. "He seems... well, too dignified for that." 
"I know!" said Bonnie. "I know exactly what he can be, and he'll hardly have to dress up at all. Look, 
he's foreign, he's sort of pale, he has that wonderful brooding look... Put him in tails and you've got a 
perfect Count Dracula!" 


Page 77 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
Elena smiled in spite of herself. "Well, I'll ask him," she said. 
"Speaking of Stefan," said Meredith, her dark eyes on Elena's, "how are things going?" 
Elena sighed, looking away into the fire. "I'm... not sure," she said at last, slowly. "There are times when 


everything is wonderful, and then there are other times when..." 
Meredith and Bonnie exchanged a glance, and then Meredith spoke gently. "Other times when what?" 
Elena hesitated, debating. Then she came to a decision. "Just a sec," she said, and got up and hurried up 


the stairs. She came back down with a small blue velvet book in her hands. 
"I wrote some of it down last night when I couldn't sleep," she said. "This says it better than I could now." 
She found the page, took a deep breath, and began: 


"October 17 


"Dear Diary, 


"I feel awful tonight. And I have to share it with someone. 


"Something is going wrong with Stefan and me. There is this terrible sadness inside him that I 
can't reach, and it's driving us apart. I don't know what to do. 


"I can't bear the thought of losing him. But he's so very unhappy about something, and if he won't 
tell me what it is, if he won't trust me that much, I don't see any hope for us. 


"Yesterday when he was holding me I felt something smooth and round underneath his shirt, 
something on a chain. I asked him, teasingly, if it was a gift from Caroline. And he just froze and 
wouldn't talk anymore. It was as if he were suddenly a thousand miles away, and his eyes... there 
was so much pain in his eyes that I could hardly stand it." 


Elena stopped reading and traced the last lines written in the journal silently with her eyes. I feel as if 
someone has hurt him terribly in the past and he's never got over it. But I also think there's 
something he's afraid of, some secret he's afraid I'll find out. If I only knew what that was, I could 
prove to him that he can trust me. That he can trust me no matter what happens, to the end. 


"If only I knew," she whispered. 


"If only you knew what?" said Meredith, and Elena looked up, startled. 


"Oh-if only I knew what was going to happen," she said quickly, closing the diary. "I mean, if I knew 
we were going to break up eventually, I suppose I'd just want to get it over with. And if I knew it was 
going to turn out all right in the end, I wouldn't mind anything that happens now. But just going day after 
day without being sure is awful." 


Bonnie bit her lip, then sat up, eyes sparkling. "I can show you a way to find out, Elena," she said. "My 
grandmother told me the way to find out who you're going to marry. It's called a dumb supper." 


. 
"Let me guess, an old druid trick," said Meredith.

"Let me guess, an old druid trick," said Meredith. 

Elena looked from Bonnie to Meredith. "I don't know," she said. "But, look, you don't really believe..." 

Bonnie drew herself up with affronted dignity. "Are you calling my mother a liar? Oh, come on, Elena, 
there's no harm in trying. Why not?" 

"What would I have to do?" said Elena doubtfully. She felt strangely intrigued, but at the same time rather 
frightened. 

"It's simple. We have to get everything ready before the stroke of midnight..." 

Five minutes before midnight, Elena stood in the McCulloughs' dining room, feeling more foolish than 
anything else. From the backyard, she could hear Yangtze's frantic barking, but inside the house there 
was no sound except the unhurried tick of the grandfather clock. Following Bonnie's instructions, she had 
set the big black walnut table with one plate, one glass, and one set of silverware, all the time not saying a 
word. Then she had lit a single candle in a candleholder in the center of the table, and positioned herself 
behind the chair with the place setting. 

According to Bonnie, on the stroke of midnight she was supposed to pull the chair back and invite her 
future husband in. At that point, the candle would blow out and she would see a ghostly figure in the 
chair. 

Earlier, she'd been a little uneasy about this, uncertain that she wanted to see any ghostly figures, even of 
her husband-to-be. But just now the whole thing seemed silly and harmless. As the clock began to chime, 
she straightened up and got a better grip on the chair back. Bonnie had told her not to let go until the 
ceremony was over. 

Oh, this was silly. Maybe she wouldn't say the words... but when the clock started to toll out the hour, 
she heard herself speaking. 

"Come in," she said self-consciously to the empty room, drawing out the chair. "Come in, come in..." 

The candle went out. 

Elena started in the sudden darkness. She'd felt the wind, a cold gust that had blown out the candle. It 
came from the French doors behind her, and she turned quickly, one hand still on the chair. She would 
have sworn those doors were shut. 

Something moved in the darkness. 

Terror washed through Elena, sweeping away her self-consciousness and any trace of amusement. Oh, 
God, what had she done, what had she brought on herself? Her heart contracted and she felt as if she 
had been plunged, without warning, into her most dreadful nightmare. It was not only dark but utterly 
silent; there was nothing to see and nothing to hear, and she was falling... 

"Allow me," said a voice, and a bright flame sputtered in the darkness. 

For a terrible, sickening instant she thought it was Tyler, remembering his lighter in the ruined church on 
the hill. But as the candle on the table sprang to life, she saw the pale, long-fingered hand that held it. Not 

Page 79 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
. 
Tyler's beefy red fist. She thought for an instant it was Stefan's, and then her eyes lifted to the face. 


Tyler's beefy red fist. She thought for an instant it was Stefan's, and then her eyes lifted to the face. 
"But you asked me to come in." His voice was as she remembered it, quiet, ironical and amused. She 
remembered the smile, too. "Thank you," he added, and gracefully sat down in the chair she had drawn 
out. 


She snatched her hand off the back. "I wasn't inviting you," she said helplessly, caught between 


indignation and embarrassment. "What were you doing hanging around outside Bonnie's house?" 
He smiled. In the candlelight, his black hair shone almost like liquid, too soft and fine for human hair. His 
face was very pale, but at the same time utterly compelling. And his eyes caught her own and held them. 


" 'Helen, thy beauty is to me/Like those Nicean barks of yore/That gently, over a perfumed sea...' " 
"I think you'd better leave now." She didn't want him to talk anymore. His voice did strange things to her, 
made her feel oddly weak, started a melting in her stomach. "You shouldn't be here. Please." She 


reached for the candle, meaning to take it and leave him, fighting off the dizziness that threatened to 
overcome her. 
But before she could grasp it, he did something extraordinary. He caught her reaching hand, not roughly 


but gently, and held it in his cool slender fingers. Then he turned her hand over, bent his dark head, and 
kissed her palm. 
"Don't..." whispered Elena, stunned. 


"Come with me," he said, and looked up into her eyes. 
"Please don't..." she whispered again, the world swimming around her. He was mad; what was he talking 
about? Come with him where? But she felt so dizzy, so faint. 


He was standing, supporting her. She leaned against him, felt those cool fingers on the first button of the 
shirt at her throat, "Please, no..." 

"It's all right. You'll see." He pulled the shirt away from her neck, his other hand behind her head. 
"No." Suddenly, strength returned to her, and she jerked away from him, stumbling against the chair. "I 
told you to leave, and I meant it. Get out-now!" 

For an instant, pure fury surged in his eyes, a dark wave of menace. Then they went calm and cold and 
he smiled, a swift, brilliant smile that he turned off again instantly. 

"I'll leave," he said. "For the moment." 
She shook her head and watched him go out the French doors without speaking. When they had shut 
behind him, she stood in the silence, trying to get her breath. 


The silence... but it shouldn't be silent. She turned toward the grandfather clock in bewilderment and saw 


Page 80 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
that it had stopped. But before she could examine it closely, she heard Meredith's and Bonnie's raised 
voices. 

She hurried out into the hall, feeling the unaccustomed weakness in her legs, pulling her shirt back up and 


buttoning it. The back door was open, and she could see two figures outside, stooping over something on 
the lawn. 

buttoning it. The back door was open, and she could see two figures outside, stooping over something on 
the lawn. 

Bonnie looked up as Elena reached them. Her eyes were filled with tears. "Oh, Elena, he's dead." 

With a chill of horror, Elena stared down at the little bundle at Bonnie's feet. It was the Pekingese, lying 
very stiffly on his side, eyes open. "Oh, Bonnie," she said. 

"He was old," said Bonnie, "but I never expected him to go this quickly. Just a little while ago, he was 
barking." 

"I think we'd better go inside," said Meredith, and Elena looked up at her and nodded. Tonight was not a 
night to be out in the dark. It was not a night to invite things inside, either. She knew that now, although 
she still didn't understand what had happened. 

It was when they got back in the living room that she found her diary was missing. 

Stefan lifted his head from the velvet-soft neck of the doe. The woods were filled with night noises, and 
he couldn't be sure which had disturbed him. 

With the Power of his mind distracted, the deer roused from its trance. He felt muscles quiver as she tried 
to get her feet under her. 

Go, then, he thought, sitting back and releasing her entirely. With a twist and a heave, she was up and 
running. 

He'd had enough. Fastidious, he licked at the corners of his mouth, feeling his canine teeth retract and 
blunt, oversensitive as always after a prolonged feed. It was hard to know what enough was anymore. 
There had been no spells of dizziness since the one beside the church, but he lived in fear of their return. 

He lived in one specific fear: that he would come to his senses one day, his mind reeling with confusion, 
to find Elena's graceful body limp in his arms, her slim throat marked with two red wounds, her heart 
stilled forever. 

That was what he had to look forward to. 

The blood lust, with all its myriad terrors and pleasures, was a mystery to him even now. Although he had 
lived with it every day for centuries, he still did not understand it. As a living human, he would no doubt 
have been disgusted, sickened, by the thought of drinking the rich warm stuff directly from a breathing 
body. That is, if someone had proposed such a thing to him in so many words. 

But no words had been used that night, the night Katherine had changed him. 

Page 81 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
Even after all these years, the memory was clear. He had been asleep when she appeared in his chamber, 
moving as softly as a vision or a ghost. He had been asleep, alone... 
She was wearing a fine linen shift when she came to him. 


It was the night before the day she had named, the day when she would announce her choice. And she 
. 
came to him. 


came to him. 


And with love. He had never seen anything more beautiful in his life. He trembled and tried to speak, but 
she put two cool fingers over his lips. 
"Hush," she whispered, and the bed sank under new weight as she got in. 
His face flamed, his heart was thundering with embarrassment and with excitement. There had never been 


a woman in his bed before. And this was Katherine, Katherine whose beauty seemed to come from 


heaven, Katherine whom he loved more than his own soul. 
And because he loved her, he made a great effort. As she slipped under the sheets, drawing so near to 
him that he could feel the cool freshness of night air in her thin shift, he managed to speak. 


"Katherine," he whispered. "We-I can wait. Until we are married in the church. I will have my father 


arrange it next week. It-it will not be long..." 
"Hush," she whispered again, and he felt that coolness on his skin. He couldn't help himself; he put his 
arms around her, holding her to him. 


"What we do now has nothing to do with that," she said, and reached out her slim fingers to stroke his 


throat. 
He understood. And felt a flash of fear, which disappeared as her fingers went on stroking. He wanted 
this, wanted anything that would let him be with Katherine. 


"Lie back, my love," she whispered. 


My love. The words sang through him as he lay back on the pillow, tilting his chin back so that his throat 
was exposed. His fear was gone, replaced by a happiness so great that he thought it would shatter him. 
He felt the soft brush of her hair on his chest, and tried to calm his breathing. He felt her breath on his 


throat, and then her lips. And then her teeth. 
There was a stinging pain, but he held himself still and made no sound, thinking only of Katherine, of how 


he wished to give to her. And almost at once the pain eased, and he felt the blood being drawn from his 
body. It was not terrible, as he had feared. It was a feeling of giving, of nurturing. 
Then it was as if their minds were merging, becoming one. He could feel Katherine's joy in drinking from 

him, her delight in taking the warm blood that gave her life. And he knew she could feel his delight in 

Page 82 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
giving. But reality was receding, the boundaries between dreams and waking becoming blurred. He could 
not think clearly; he could not think at all. He could only feel, and his feelings were spiraling up and up, 
carrying him higher and higher, breaking his last ties with earth. 

Sometime later, without knowing how he had gotten there, he found himself in her arms. She was cradling 
him like a mother holding an infant child, guiding his mouth to rest on the bare flesh just above the low 
neck of her night shift. There was a tiny wound there, a cut showing dark against the pale skin. He felt no 
fear or hesitation, and when she stroked his hair encouragingly, he began to suck. 


Cold and precise, Stefan brushed dirt off his knees. The human world was asleep, lost in stupor, but his 
own senses were knife-keen. He should have been sated, but he was hungry again; the memory had 
wakened his appetite. Nostrils flaring wide to catch the musky scent of fox, he began to hunt.

&laquo; ^ &raquo; 

Elena revolved slowly before the full-length mirror in Aunt Judith's bedroom. Margaret sat at the foot of 
the big four-poster bed, her blue eyes large and solemn with admiration. 

"I wish I had a dress like that for trick-or-treat," she said. 

"I like you best as a little white cat," said Elena, dropping a kiss between the white velvet ears attached to 
Margaret's headband. Then she turned to her aunt, who stood by the door with needle and thread ready. 
"It's perfect," she said warmly. "We don't have to change a thing." 

The girl in the mirror could have stepped out of one of Elena's books on the Italian Renaissance. Her 
throat and shoulders were bare, and the tight bodice of the ice-blue dress showed off her tiny waist. The 
long, full sleeves were slashed so that the white silk of the chemise underneath showed through, and the 
wide, sweeping skirt just brushed the floor all around her. It was a beautiful dress, and the pale clear blue 
seemed to heighten the darker blue of Elena's eyes. 

As she turned away, Elena's gaze fell on the old-fashioned pendulum clock above the dresser. "Oh, no-
it's almost seven. Stefan will be here any minute." 

"That's his car now," said Aunt Judith, glancing out the window. "I'll go down and let him in." 

"That's all right," said Elena briefly. "I'll meet him myself. Good-bye, have a good time trick-or-treating!" 
She hurried down the stairs. 

Here goes, she thought. As she reached for the doorknob, she was reminded of that day, nearly two 
months ago now, when she'd stepped directly into Stefan's path in European History class. She'd had this 
same feeling of anticipation, of excitement and tension. 

I just hope this turns out better than that plan did, she thought. For the last week and a half, she'd pinned 
her hopes to this moment, to this night. If she and Stefan didn't come together tonight, they never would. 

The door swung open, and she stepped back with her eyes down, feeling almost shy, afraid to see 

Page 83 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
Stefan's face. But when she heard his sharp indrawn breath, she looked up quickly-and felt her heart go 
cold. 

He was staring at her in wonder, yes. But it was not the wondering joy she'd seen in his eyes that first 
night in his room. This was something closer to shock. 

"You don't like it," she whispered, horrified at the stinging in her eyes. 

He recovered swiftly, as always, blinking and shaking his head. "No, no, it's beautiful. You're beautiful." 

Then why are you standing there looking as if you'd seen a ghost? she thought. Why don't you hold me, 


kiss me-something! 

kiss me-something! 

"We'd better go," he said, equally quiet and serious. 

Elena nodded and went with him to the car, but her heart was no longer merely cold; it was ice. He was 
further away from her than ever, and she had no idea how to get him back. 

Thunder growled overhead as they drove to the high school, and Elena glanced out of the car window 
with dull dismay. The cloud cover was thick and dark, although it hadn't actually begun to rain yet. The 
air had a charged, electric feel, and the sullen purple thunderheads gave the sky a nightmarish look. It 
was a perfect atmosphere for Halloween, menacing and otherworldly, but it woke only dread in Elena. 
Since that night at Bonnie's, she'd lost her appreciation for the eerie and uncanny. 

Her diary had never turned up, although they'd searched Bonnie's house top to bottom. She still couldn't 
believe that it was really gone, and the idea of a stranger reading her most private thoughts made her feel 
wild inside. Because, of course, it had been stolen; what other explanation was there? More than one 
door had been open that night at the McCullough house; someone could have just walked in. She wanted 
to kill whoever had done it. 

A vision of dark eyes rose before her. That boy, the boy she'd almost given in to at Bonnie's house, the 
boy who'd made her forget Stefan. Was he the one? 

She roused herself as they pulled up to the school and forced herself to smile as they made their way 
through the halls. The gym was barely organized chaos. In the hour since Elena had left, everything had 
changed. Then, the place had been full of seniors: Student Council members, football players, the Key 
Club, all putting the finishing touches on props and scenery. Now it was full of strangers, most of them 
not even human. 

Several zombies turned as Elena came in, their grinning skulls visible through the rotting flesh of their 
faces. A grotesquely deformed hunchback limped toward her, along with a corpse with livid white skin 
and hollow eyes. From another direction came a werewolf, its snarling muzzle covered with blood, and a 
dark and dramatic witch. 

Elena realized, with a jolt, that she couldn't recognize half these people in their costumes. Then they were 
around her, admiring the ice-blue gown, announcing problems that had developed already. Elena waved 
them quiet and turned toward the witch, whose long dark hair flowed down the back of a tight-fitting 

Page 84

black dress. 
"What is it, Meredith?" she said. 
"Coach Lyman's sick," Meredith replied grimly, "so somebody got Tanner to substitute." 
"Mr. Tanner?" Elena was horrified. 
"Yes, and he's making trouble already. Poor Bonnie's just about had it. You'd better get over there." 
Elena sighed and nodded, then made her way along the twisting route of the Haunted House tour. As she 


passed through the grisly Torture Chamber and the ghastly Mad Slasher Room, she thought they had 


almost built too well. This place was unnerving even in the light. 

The Druid Room was near the exit. There, a cardboard Stonehenge had been constructed. But the pretty 
little druid priestess who stood among the rather realistic-looking monoliths wearing white robes and an 
oak-leaf garland looked ready to burst into tears. 

The Druid Room was near the exit. There, a cardboard Stonehenge had been constructed. But the pretty 
little druid priestess who stood among the rather realistic-looking monoliths wearing white robes and an 
oak-leaf garland looked ready to burst into tears. 

"Wearing these ridiculous robes is bad enough," replied Tanner shortly. "No one informed me I was 

going to have to smear syrup all over myself." 
"It doesn't really get on you," said Bonnie. "It's just on the robes and on the altar. You're a sacrifice," she 
repeated, as if somehow this would convince him. 


"As for that," said Mr. Tanner in disgust, 


"the accuracy of this whole setup is highly suspect. Contrary to popular belief, the druids did not build 
Stonehenge; it was built by a Bronze Age culture that-" 
Elena stepped forward. "Mr. Tanner, that isn't really the point." 
"No, it wouldn't be, to you," he said. "Which is why you and your neurotic friend here are both failing 


history." 
"That's uncalled for," said a voice, and Elena looked quickly over her shoulder at Stefan. 
"Mister Salvatore," said Tanner, pronouncing the words as if they meant Now my day is complete. "I 


suppose you have some new words of wisdom to offer. Or are you going to give me a black eye?" His 
gaze traveled over Stefan, who stood there, unconsciously elegant in his perfectly tailored tux, and Elena 
felt a sudden shock of insight. 

Tanner isn't really that much older than we are, she thought. He looks old because of that receding 
hairline, but I'll bet he's in his twenties. Then, for some reason, she remembered how Tanner had looked 
at Homecoming, in his cheap and shiny suit that didn't fit well. 

I'll bet he never even made it to his own homecoming, she thought. And, for the first time, she felt 

Page 85 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
something like sympathy for him. 
Perhaps Stefan felt it, too, for although he stepped right up to the little man, standing face-to-face with 
him, his voice was quiet. "No, I'm not. I think this whole thing is getting blown out of proportion. Why 
don't..." Elena couldn't hear the rest, but he was speaking in low, calming tones, and Mr. Tanner actually 


seemed to be listening. She glanced back at the crowd that had gathered behind her: four or five ghouls, 
the werewolf, a gorilla, and a hunchback. 
"All right, everything's under control," she said, and they dispersed. Stefan was taking care of things, 


although she was not sure how, since she could see only the back of his head. 
The back of his head... For an instant, an image flashed before her of the first day of school. Of how 
Stefan had stood in the office talking to Mrs. Clarke, the secretary, and of how oddly Mrs. Clarke had 


acted. Sure enough, when Elena looked at Mr. Tanner now, he wore the same slightly dazed expression. 
Elena felt a slow ripple of disquiet. 
"Come on," she said to Bonnie. "Let's go up front." 
They cut straight through the Alien Landing Room and the Living Dead Room, slipping between the 


partitions, coming out in the first room where visitors would enter and be greeted by a werewolf. The

werewolf had taken his head off and was talking to a couple of mummies and an Egyptian princess. 
werewolf had taken his head off and was talking to a couple of mummies and an Egyptian princess. 
"How's it going here?" said Elena with forced lightness. 
Matt started slightly, then turned toward her and Bonnie. Elena had scarcely seen him since the night of 


Homecoming, and she knew that he and Stefan had drawn apart, too. Because of her. And though Matt 
could hardly be blamed for that, either, she could tell how much it hurt Stefan. 

"Everything's fine," said Matt, looking uncomfortable. 
"When Stefan finishes with Tanner, I think I'll send him up here," Elena said. "He can help bring people 
in." 


Matt lifted one shoulder indifferently. Then he said, "Finishes what with Tanner?" 


Elena looked at him in surprise. She could have sworn he'd been in the Druid Room a minute ago to see 
it. She explained. 
Outside, thunder rumbled again, and through the open door Elena saw a flash light the night sky. There 


was another, louder clap of thunder a few seconds later. 
"I hope it doesn't rain," Bonnie said. 
"Yes," said Caroline, who had been standing silent while Elena spoke to Matt. "It would be such a pity if 


nobody came." 
Elena glanced at her sharply and saw open hatred in Caroline's narrow, catlike eyes. 


Page 86 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
"Caroline," she said impulsively, "look. Can't you and I call it quits? Can't we forget what's happened and 
start over?" 

Under the cobra on her forehead, Caroline's eyes widened and then slitted again. Her mouth twisted, and 
she stepped closer to Elena. 

"I will never forget," she said, and then she turned and left. 

There was a silence, Bonnie and Matt looking at the floor. Elena stepped over to the doorway to feel 
cool air on her cheeks. Outside she could see the field and the tossing branches of the oak trees beyond, 
and once again she was overcome with that strange feeling of foreboding. Tonight's the night, she thought 
wretchedly. Tonight's the night when it all happens. But what "it" was, she had no idea. 

A voice sounded through the transformed gym. "All right, they're about to let the line in from the parking 
lot. Cut the lights, Ed!" Suddenly, gloom descended and the air was filled with groans and maniacal 
laughter, like an orchestra tuning up. Elena sighed and turned. 

"Better get ready to start herding them through," she told Bonnie quietly. Bonnie nodded and disappeared 
into the darkness. Matt had donned his werewolf head, and was turning on a tape deck that added eerie 
music to the cacophony. 

Stefan came around the corner, his hair and clothing melting into the darkness. Only his white shirtfront 
showed up clearly. "Everything worked out with Tanner," he said. "Is there anything else I can do?" 


"Well, you could work here, with Matt, bringing people in..." Elena's voice trailed off. Matt was bent 
over the tape deck, minutely adjusting the volume, not looking up. Elena looked at Stefan and saw his 
face was tight and blank. "Or you could go into the boys' locker room and be in charge of coffee and 
things for the workers," she finished tiredly.

things for the workers," she finished tiredly. 

"Stefan? Are you all right?" 

"Fine," he said, recovering his balance. "A little tired, that's all." She watched him go, her chest feeling 
heavier every minute. 

She turned to Matt, meaning to say something to him, but at that moment the line of visitors reached the 
door. 

"Show's on," he said, and crouched in the shadows. 

Elena moved from room to room, troubleshooting. In years before, she had enjoyed this part of the night 
the most, watching the gruesome scenes being acted out and the delicious terror of the visitors, but 
tonight there was a feeling of dread and tension underlying all her thoughts. Tonight's the night, she 
thought again, and the ice in her chest seemed to thicken. 

Page 87 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
A Grim Reaper-or at least that was what she supposed the hooded figure in black robes was-passed 
by her, and she found herself absent-mindedly trying to remember if she had seen it at any of the 
Halloween parties. There was something familiar about the way the figure moved. 


Bonnie exchanged a harassed smile with the tall, slender witch who was directing traffic into the Spider 
Room. Several junior high boys were slapping at the dangling rubber spiders and shouting and generally 
making a nuisance of themselves. Bonnie hustled them on into the Druid Room. 


Here the strobe lights gave the scene a dreamlike quality. Bonnie felt a grim triumph to see Mr. Tanner 
stretched out on the stone altar, his white robes heavily stained with blood, his eyes glaring at the ceiling. 


"Cool!" shouted one of the boys, racing up to the altar. Bonnie stood back and grinned, waiting for the 
bloody sacrifice to rear up and scare the wits out of the kid. 


But Mr. Tanner didn't move, even when the boy plunged a hand into the pool of blood by the sacrifice's 
head. 


That's strange, Bonnie thought, hurrying up to prevent the kid from grabbing the sacrificial knife. 


"Don't do that," she snapped, so he held up his gory hand instead, and it showed red in every sharp flash 
of the strobe. Bonnie felt a sudden irrational fear that Mr. Tanner was going to wait until she bent over 
him and then make her jump. But he just kept staring at the ceiling. 


"Mr. Tanner, are you okay? Mr. Tanner? Mr. Tanner!" 


Not a movement, not a sound. Not a flicker of those wide white eyes. Don't touch him, something in 
Bonnie's mind told her suddenly and urgently. Don't touch him don't touch him don't touch... 


Under the strobe lights she saw her own hand move forward, saw it grasp Mr. Tanner's shoulder and 


. 
shake it, saw his head flop bonelessly toward her. Then she saw his throat. 


shake it, saw his head flop bonelessly toward her. Then she saw his throat. 


Elena heard the screams. They were shrill and sustained and unlike any other sounds in the Haunted 
House, and she knew at once that they were no joke. 


Everything after that was a nightmare. 


Reaching the Druid Room at a run, she saw a tableau, but not the one prepared for visitors. Bonnie was 
screaming, Meredith holding her shoulders. Three young boys were trying to get out of the curtained exit, 
and two bouncers were looking in, blocking their way. Mr. Tanner was lying on the stone altar, sprawled 
out, and his face... 


"He's dead," Bonnie was sobbing, the screams turning into words. "Oh, God, the blood's real, and he's 
dead. I touched him, Elena, and he's dead, he's really dead..." 


People were coining into the room. Someone else began screaming and it spread, and then everyone was 
trying to get out, pushing each other in panic, knocking into the partitions. 


Page 88 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
"Get the lights on!" Elena shouted, and heard the shout taken up by others. "Meredith, quick, get to a 
phone in the gym and call an ambulance, call the police... Get those lights on!" 


When the lights snapped on, Elena looked around, but she could see no adults, no one entitled to take 
charge of the situation. Part of her was ice-cold, her mind racing as it tried to think what to do next. Part 
of her was simply numb with horror. Mr. Tanner... She had never liked him, but somehow that only 
made it worse. 


"Get all the kids out of here. Everybody but staff out," she said. 


"No! Shut the doors! Don't let anybody out until the police get here," shouted a werewolf beside her, 
taking off his mask. Elena turned in astonishment at the voice and saw that it was not Matt, it was Tyler 
Smallwood. 


He'd been allowed back in school only this week, and his face was still discolored from the beating he 
had taken at Stefan's hands. But his voice had the ring of authority, and Elena saw the bouncers close the 
exit door. She heard another door close across the gym. 


Of the dozen or so people crowded into the Stonehenge area, Elena recognized only one as a worker. 
The rest were people she knew from school, but none she knew well. One of them, a boy dressed as a 
pirate, spoke to Tyler. 


"You mean... you think somebody in here did it?" 


"Somebody in here did it, all right," said Tyler. There was a queer, excited sound to his voice, as if he 
were almost enjoying this. He gestured to the pool of blood on the rock. "That's still liquid; it can't have 
happened too long ago. And look at the way his throat's cut. The killer must have done it with that." He 
pointed to the sacrificial knife. 


"Then the killer might be here right now," whispered a girl in a kimono. 


"And it's not hard to guess who it is," said Tyler. "Somebody who hated Tanner, who was always getting

in arguments with him. Somebody who was arguing with him earlier tonight. I saw it." 


in arguments with him. Somebody who was arguing with him earlier tonight. I saw it." 


"Somebody who has a history of violence," Tyler was continuing, his lips drawing back from his teeth. 
"Somebody who, for all we know, is a psychopath who came to Fell's Church just to kill." 


"Tyler, what are you talking about?" Elena's dazed feeling had burst like a bubble. Furious, she stepped 
toward the tall, husky boy. "You're crazy!" 


He gestured at her without looking at her. "So says his girlfriend-but maybe she's a little prejudiced." 


"And maybe you're a little prejudiced, Tyler," said a voice from behind the crowd, and Elena saw a 
second werewolf pushing his way into the room. Matt. 


"Oh, yeah? Well, why don't you tell us what you know about Salvatore? Where does he come from? 
Where's his family? Where did he get all that money?" Tyler turned to address the rest of the crowd. 


Page 89

"Who knows anything about him?" 


People were shaking their heads. Elena could see, in face after face, distrust blossoming. The distrust of 
anything unknown, anything different. And Stefan was different. He was the stranger in their midst, and 
just now they needed a scapegoat. 


The girl in the kimono began, "I heard a rumor-" 


"That's all anybody's heard, rumors!" Tyler said. "No one really knows a thing about him. But there's one 
thing I do know. The attacks in Fell's Church started the first week of school-which was the week 
Stefan Salvatore came." 


There was a swelling murmur at this, and Elena herself felt a shock of realization. Of course, it was all 
ridiculous, it was just a coincidence. But what Tyler was saying was true. The attacks had started when 
Stefan arrived. 


"I'll tell you something else," shouted Tyler, gesturing at them to be quiet. "Listen to me! I'll tell you 
something else!" He waited until everyone was looking at him and then said slowly, impressively, "He was 
in the cemetery the night Vickie Bennett was attacked." 


"Sure he was in the cemetery-rearranging your face," said Matt, but his voice lacked its usual strength. 
Tyler grabbed the comment and ran with it. 


"Yes, and he almost killed me. And tonight somebody did kill Tanner. I don't know what you think, but I 
think he did it. I think he's the one!" 


"But where is he?" shouted someone from the crowd. 


Tyler looked around. "If he did it, he must still be here," he shouted. "Let's find him." 


"Stefan hasn't done anything! Tyler-" cried Elena, but the noise from the crowd overrode her. Tyler's 
words were being taken up and repeated. Find him... find him . . . find him. Elena heard it pass from 
person to person. And the faces in the Stonehenge Room were filled with more than distrust now; Elena 
could see anger and a thirst for vengeance in them, too. The crowd had turned into something ugly, 
something beyond controlling. 


. 
"Where is he, Elena?" said Tyler, and she saw the blazing triumph in his eyes. He was enjoying this. 


"Where is he, Elena?" said Tyler, and she saw the blazing triumph in his eyes. He was enjoying this. 


"He must still be here! Find him!" someone shouted, and then it seemed everyone was moving, pointing, 
pushing, at once. Partitions were being knocked down and shoved aside. 


Elena's heart was pounding. This was no longer a crowd; it was a mob. She was terrified of what they 
would do to Stefan if they did find him. But if she tried to go warn him, she would lead Tyler right to him. 


She looked around desperately. Bonnie was still staring into Mr. Tanner's dead face. No help there. She 
turned to scan the crowd again, and her eyes met Matt's. 


He was looking confused and angry, his blond hair ruffled up, cheeks flushed and sweaty. Elena put all 


Page 90 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
her strength of will into a look of pleading. 

Please, Matt, she thought. You can't believe all this. You know it isn't true. 

But his eyes showed that he didn't know. There was a tumult of bewilderment and agitation in them. 

Please, thought Elena, gazing into those blue eyes, willing him to understand. Oh, please, Matt, only you 
can save him. Even if you don't believe, please try to trust... please... 

She saw the change come over his face, the confusion lifting as grim determination appeared. He stared 
at her another moment, eyes boring into hers, and nodded once. Then he turned and slipped into the 
milling, hunting crowd. 

Matt knifed through the crowd cleanly until he got to the other side of the gym. There were some 
freshmen standing near the door to the boys' locker room; he brusquely ordered them to start moving 
fallen partitions, and when their attention was distracted he jerked the door open and ducked inside. 

He looked around quickly, unwilling to shout. For that matter, he thought, Stefan must have heard all the 
racket going on in the gym. He'd probably already cut out. But then Matt saw the black-clad figure on 
the white tile floor. 

"Stefan! What happened?" For a terrible instant, Matt thought he was looking down on a second dead 
body. But as he knelt by Stefan's side, he saw movement. 

"Hey, you're okay, just sit up slowly... easy. Are you all right, Stefan?" 

"Yes," said Stefan. He didn't look okay, Matt thought. His face was dead white and his pupils were 
dilated hugely. He looked disoriented and sick. "Thank you," he said. 

"You may not thank me in a minute. Stefan, you've got to get out of here. Can't you hear them? They're 
after you." 

Stefan turned toward the gym, as if listening. But there was no comprehension on his face. "Who's after 
me? Why?" 

"Everybody. It doesn't matter. What matters is that you've got to get out before they come in here." As 
Stefan continued simply to stare blankly, he added, "There's been another attack, this time on Tanner, 
Mr. Tanner. He's dead, Stefan, and they think you did it." 


Now, at last, he saw understanding come to Stefan's eyes. Understanding and horror and a kind of 
resigned defeat that was more frightening than anything Matt had seen tonight. He gripped Stefan's 
shoulder hard. 

Now, at last, he saw understanding come to Stefan's eyes. Understanding and horror and a kind of 
resigned defeat that was more frightening than anything Matt had seen tonight. He gripped Stefan's 
shoulder hard. 

"Get out... yes," said Stefan. The look of disorientation was gone, and there was a searing bitterness in 
the way he pronounced the words. "I will... get out." 

Page 91 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
"Stefan..." 


"Matt." The green eyes were dark and burning, and Matt found he could not look away from them. "Is 
Elena safe? Good. Then, take care of her. Please." 
"Stefan, what are you talking about? You're innocent; this will all blow over..." 
"Just take care of her, Matt." 
Matt stepped back, still looking into those compelling green eyes. Then, slowly, he nodded. 
"I will," he said quietly. And watched Stefan go. 
Chapter Thirteen 
&laquo; ^ &raquo; 
Elena stood within the circle of adults and police, waiting for a chance to escape. She knew that Matt 


had warned Stefan in time-his face told her that-but he hadn't been able to get close enough to speak 


with her. 
At last, with all attention turned toward the body, she detached herself from the group and edged toward 
Matt. 


"Stefan got out all right," he said, his eyes on the group of adults. "But he told me to take care of you, and 


I want you to stay here." 
"To take care of me?" Alarm and suspicion flashed through Elena. Then, almost in a whisper, she said, "I 
see." She thought a moment and then spoke carefully. "Matt, I need to go wash my hands. Bonnie got 
blood on me. Wait here; I'll be back." 


He started to say something in protest, but she was already moving away. She held up her stained hands 
in explanation as she reached the door of the girls' locker room, and the teacher who was now standing 
there let her through. Once in the locker room, however, she kept on going, right out the far door and 
into the darkened school. And from there, into the night. 


Zuccone! Stefan thought, grabbing a bookcase and flinging it over, sending its contents flying. Fool! 


Blind, hateful fool. How could he have been so stupid? 
. 
Find a place with them here? Be accepted as one of them? He must have been mad to have thought it 
was possible. 


Find a place with them here? Be accepted as one of them? He must have been mad to have thought it 


was possible. 
Who was after him? Everybody. Matt had said it. "There's been another attack... They think you did 
it." 


Well, for once it looked as if the barbari, the petty living humans with their fear of anything unknown, 
were right. How else did you explain what had happened? He had felt the weakness, the spinning, 


Page 92 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
swirling confusion; and then darkness had taken him. When he'd awakened it was to hear Matt saying 
that another human had been pillaged, assaulted. Robbed this time not only of his blood, but of his life. 
How did you explain that unless he, Stefan, were the killer? 

A killer was what he was. Evil. A creature born in the dark, destined to live and hunt and hide there 
forever. Well, why not kill, then? Why not fulfill his nature? Since he could not change it, he might as well 
revel in it. He would unleash his darkness upon this town that hated him, that hunted him even now. 

But first... he was thirsty. His veins burned like a network of dry, hot wires. He needed to feed... soon 
... now. 

The boarding house was dark. Elena knocked at the door but received no answer. Thunder cracked 
overhead. There was still no rain. 

After the third barrage of knocking, she tried the door, and it opened. Inside, the house was silent and 
pitch black. She made her way to the staircase by feel and went up it. 

The second landing was just as dark, and she stumbled, trying to find the bedroom with the stairway to 
the third floor. A faint light showed at the top of the stairs, and she climbed toward it, feeling oppressed 
by the walls, which seemed to close in on her from either side. 

The light came from beneath the closed door. Elena tapped on it lightly and quickly. "Stefan," she 
whispered, and then she called more loudly, "Stefan, it's me." 

No answer. She grasped the knob and pushed the door open, peering around the side. "Stefan-" 

She was speaking to an empty room. 

And a room filled with chaos. It looked as if some great wind had torn through, leaving destruction in its 
path. The trunks that had stood in corners so sedately were lying at grotesque angles, their lids gaping 
open, their contents strewn about the floor. One window was shattered. All Stefan's possessions, all the 
things he had kept so carefully and seemed to prize, were scattered like rubbish. 

Terror swept through Elena. The fury, the violence in this scene of devastation were painfully clear, and 
they made her feel almost giddy. Somebody who has a history of violence, Tyler had said. 

I don't care, she thought, anger surging up to push back the fear. I don't care about anything, Stefan; I 
still want to see you. But where are you? 

The trapdoor in the ceiling was open, and cold air was blowing down. Oh, thought Elena, and she had a 
sudden chill of fear. That roof was so high... 


She'd never climbed the ladder to the widow's walk before, and her long skirt made it difficult. She 
emerged through the trapdoor slowly, kneeling on the roof and then standing up. She saw a dark figure in 
the corner, and she moved toward it quickly.

Page 93 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
Oh, God... no. Her mind refused to make sense of what her eyes were seeing. No. No. She wouldn't 
look at this, she wouldn't believe it... 

But she could not help seeing. Even if she could have shut her eyes, every detail of the scene was etched 
upon her memory. As if the flash of lightning had seared it onto her brain forever. 

Stefan. Stefan, so sleek and elegant in his ordinary clothes, in his black leather jacket with the collar 
turned up. Stefan, with his dark hair like one of the roiling storm clouds behind him. Stefan had been 
caught in that flash of light, half turned toward her, his body twisted into a bestial crouch, with a snarl of 
animal fury on his face. 

And blood. That arrogant, sensitive, sensual mouth was smeared with blood. It showed ghastly red 
against the pallor of his skin, against the sharp whiteness of his bared teeth. In his hands was the limp 
body of a mourning dove, white as those teeth, wings outspread. Another lay on the ground at his feet, 
like a crumpled and discarded handkerchief. 

"Oh, God, no," Elena whispered. She went on whispering it, backing away, scarcely aware that she was 
doing either. Her mind simply could not cope with this horror; her thoughts were running wildly in panic, 
like mice trying to escape a cage. She wouldn't believe this, she wouldn't believe. Her body was filled 
with unbearable tension, her heart was bursting, her head reeling. 

"Oh, God, no-" 

"Elena!" More terrible than anything else was this, to see Stefan looking at her out of that animal face, to 
see the snarl changing into a look of shock and desperation. "Elena, please. Please, don't..." 

"Oh, God, no!" The screams were trying to rip their way out of her throat. She backed farther away, 
stumbling, as he took a step toward her. "No!" 

"Elena, please-be careful-" That terrible thing, the thing with Stefan's face, was coming after her, green 
eyes burning. She flung herself backward as he took another step, his hand outstretched. That long, 
slender-fingered hand that had stroked her hair so gently-

"Don't touch me!" she cried. And then she did scream, as her motion brought her back against the iron 
railing of the widow's walk. It was iron that had been there for nearly a century and a half, and in places it 
was nearly rusted through. Elena's panicked weight against it was too much, and she felt it give way. She 
heard the tearing sound of overstressed metal and wood mingling with her own shriek. And then there 
was nothing behind her, nothing to grab on to, and she was falling. 

In that instant, she saw the seething purple clouds, the dark bulk of the house beside her. It seemed that 
she had enough time to see them clearly, and to feel an infinity of terror as she screamed and fell, and fell. 

But the terrible, shattering impact never came. Suddenly there were arms around her, supporting her in 
the void. There was a dull thud and the arms tightened, weight giving against her, absorbing the crash. 
Then all was still. 


She held herself motionless within the circle of those arms, trying to get her bearings. Trying to believe yet 
another unbelievable thing. She had fallen from a three-story roof, and yet she was alive. She was 
standing in the garden behind the boarding house, in the utter silence between claps of thunder, with fallen 
leaves on the ground where her broken body should be.

She held herself motionless within the circle of those arms, trying to get her bearings. Trying to believe yet 
another unbelievable thing. She had fallen from a three-story roof, and yet she was alive. She was 
standing in the garden behind the boarding house, in the utter silence between claps of thunder, with fallen 
leaves on the ground where her broken body should be. 

There had been too much fear, too many blows tonight. She could react no longer. She could only stare 
up at him with a kind of wonder. 

There was such sadness in his eyes. Those eyes that had burned like green ice were now dark and 
empty, hopeless. The same look that she'd seen that first night in his room, only now it was worse. For 
now there was self-hatred mixed with the sorrow, and bitter condemnation. She couldn't bear it. 

"Stefan," she whispered, feeling that sadness enter her own soul. She could still see the tinge of red on his 
lips, but now it awakened a thrill of pity along with the instinctive horror. To be so alone, so alien and so 
alone... 

"Oh, Stefan," she whispered. 

There was no answer in those bleak, lost eyes. "Come," he said quietly, and led her back toward the 
house. 

Stefan felt a rush of shame as they reached the third story and the destruction that was his room. That 
Elena, of all people, should see this was insupportable. But then, perhaps it was also fitting that she 
should see what he truly was, what he could do. 

She moved slowly, dazedly to the bed and sat. Then she looked up at him, her shadowed eyes meeting 
his. "Tell me," was all she said. 

He laughed shortly, without humor, and saw her flinch. It made him hate himself more. "What do you 
need to know?" he said. He put a foot on the lid of an overturned trunk and faced her almost defiantly, 
indicating the room with a gesture. "Who did this? I did." 

"You're strong," she said, her eyes on a capsized trunk. Her gaze lifted upward, as if she were 
remembering what had happened on the roof. "And quick." 

"Stronger than a human," he said, with deliberate emphasis on the last word. Why didn't she cringe from 
him now, why didn't she look at him with the loathing he had seen before? He didn't care what she 
thought any longer. "My reflexes are faster, and I'm more resilient. I have to be. I'm a hunter," he said 
harshly. 

Something in her look made him remember how she had interrupted him. He wiped his mouth with the 
back of his hand, then went quickly to pick up a glass of water that stood unharmed on the nightstand. 
He could feel her eyes on him as he drank it and wiped his mouth again. Oh, he still cared what she 
thought, all right. 

"You can eat and drink... other things," she said. 

"I don't need to," he said quietly, feeling weary and subdued. "I don't need anything else." He whipped 
around suddenly and felt passionate intensity rise in him again. "You said I was quick-but that's just 
what I'm not. Have you ever heard the saying 'the quick and the dead,' Elena? Quick means living; it

. 
means those who have life. I'm the other half." 


means those who have life. I'm the other half." 


He recognized those words. And they were as true as when she had first said them. "Yes, I suppose you 
do," he said, and his voice was tired and hard. He stared at the broken window for a few heartbeats and 
then looked back at her and spoke flatly. "I was born in the late fifteenth century. Do you believe that?" 


She looked at the objects that lay where he'd scattered them from the bureau with one furious sweep of 
his arm. The florins, the agate cup, his dagger. "Yes," she said softly. "Yes, I believe it." 


"And you want to know more? How I came to be what I am?" When she nodded, he turned to the 
window again. How could he tell her? He, who had avoided questions for so long, who had become 
such an expert at hiding and deceiving. 


There was only one way, and that was to tell the absolute truth, concealing nothing. To lay it all before 
her, what he had never offered to any other soul. 


And he wanted to do it. Even though he knew it would make her turn away from him in the end, he 
needed to show Elena what he was. 


And so, staring into the darkness outside the window, where flashes of blue brilliance occasionally lit the 
sky, he began. 


He spoke dispassionately, without emotion, carefully choosing his words. He told her of his father, that 
solid Renaissance man, and of his world in Florence and at their country estate. He told her of his studies 
and his ambitions. Of his brother, who was so different than he, and of the ill feeling between them. 


"I don't know when Damon started hating me," he said. "It was always that way, as long as I can 
remember. Maybe it was because my mother never really recovered from my birth. She died a few years 
later. Damon loved her very much, and I always had the feeling that he blamed me." He paused and 
swallowed. "And then, later, there was a girl." 


"The one I remind you of?" Elena said softly. He nodded. "The one," she said, more hesitantly, "who gave 
you the ring?" 


He glanced down at the silver ring on his finger, then met her eyes. Then, slowly, he drew out the ring he 
wore on the chain beneath his shirt and looked at it. 


"Yes. This was her ring," he said. "Without such a talisman, we die in sunlight as if in a fire." 


"Then she was... like you?" 


"She made me what I am." Haltingly, he told her about Katherine. About Katherine's beauty and 
sweetness, and about his love for her. And about Damon's. 


"She was too gentle, filled with too much affection," he said at last, painfully. "She gave it to everyone, 
including my brother. But finally, we told her she had to choose between us. And then... she came to 
me." 


Page 96 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
The memory of that night, of that sweet, terrible night came sweeping back. She had come to him. And 
he had been so happy, so full of awe and joy. He tried to tell Elena about that, to find the words. All that 
night he had been so happy, and even the next morning, when he had awakened and she was gone, he 


. 
had been throned on highest bliss... 


had been throned on highest bliss... 


Her blood burned in his veins now, he thought, and the very words made his heart race. She had given 
her strength to him; she had chosen him. 


He even had a smile for Damon when they met at the designated place that evening. Damon had been 
absent from the house all day, but he showed up in the meticulously landscaped garden precisely on time, 
and stood lounging against a tree, adjusting his cuff. Katherine was late. 


"Perhaps she is tired," Stefan suggested, watching the melon-colored sky fade into deep midnight blue. 
He tried to keep the shy smugness from his voice. "Perhaps she needs more rest than usual." 


Damon glanced at him sharply, his dark eyes piercing under the shock of black hair. "Perhaps," he said 
on a rising note, as if he would have said more. 


But then they heard a light step on the path, and Katherine appeared between the box hedges. She was 
wearing her white gown, and she was as beautiful as an angel. 


She had a smile for both of them. Stefan returned the smile politely, speaking their secret only with his 
eyes. Then he waited. 


"You asked me to make my choice," she said, looking first at him and then at his brother. "And now you 
have come at the hour I appointed, and I will tell you what I have chosen." 


She held up her small hand, the one with the ring on it, and Stefan looked at the stone, realizing it was the 
same deep blue as the evening sky. It was as if Katherine carried a piece of the night with her, always. 


"You have both seen this ring," she said quietly. "And you know that without it I would die. It is not easy 
to have such talismans made, but fortunately my woman Gudren is clever. And there are many 
silversmiths in Florence." 


Stefan was listening without comprehension, but when she turned to him he smiled again, encouragingly. 


"And so," she said, gazing into his eyes. "I have had a present made for you." She took his hand and 
pressed something into it. When he looked he saw that it was a ring in the same fashion as her own, but 
larger and heavier, and wrought in silver instead of gold. 


"You do not need it yet to face the sun," she said softly, smiling. "But very soon you will." 


Pride and rapture made him mute. He reached for her hand to kiss it, wanting to take her into his arms 
right then, even in front of Damon. But Katherine was turning away. 


"And for you," she said, and Stefan thought his ears must be betraying him, for surely the warmth, the 


Page 97 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
fondness in Katherine's voice could not be for his brother, "for you, also. You will need ft very soon as 
well." 


Stefan's eyes must be traitors, too. They were showing him what was impossible, what could not be. Into 
Damon's hand Katherine was putting a ring just like his own. 


. 
The silence that followed was absolute, like the silence after the world's ending. 


The silence that followed was absolute, like the silence after the world's ending. 


"What you shared?" Damon's voice was like the crack of a whip, and he turned on Stefan angrily. "Last 
night she came to me. The choice is already made." And Damon jerked down his high collar to show two 
tiny wounds in his throat. Stefan stared at them, fighting down the bright sickness. They were identical to 
his own wounds. 


He shook his head in utter bewilderment. "But, Katherine... it was not a dream. You came to me..." 


"I came to both of you." Katherine's voice was tranquil, even pleased, and her eyes were serene. She 
smiled at Damon and then at Stefan in turn. "It has weakened me, but I am so glad I did. Don't you see?" 
she continued as they stared at her, too stunned to speak. "This is my choice! I love you both, and I will 
not give either of you up. Now we all three will be together, and be happy." 


"Happy-" Stefan choked out. 


"Yes, happy! The three of us will be companions, joyous companions, forever." Her voice rose with 
elation, and the light of a radiant child shone in her eyes. "We will be together always, never feeling 
sickness, never growing old, until the end of time! That is my choice." 


"Happy... with him?" Damon's voice was shaking with fury, and Stefan saw that his normally 
self-contained brother was white with rage. "With this boy standing between us, this prating, mouthing 
paragon of virtue? I can barely stand the sight of him now. I wish to God that I should never see him 
again, never hear his voice again!" 


"And I wish the same of you, brother," snarled Stefan, his heart tearing in his breast. This was Damon's 
fault; Damon had poisoned Katherine's mind so that she no longer knew what she was doing. "And I 
have half a mind to make sure of it," he added savagely. 


Damon did not mistake his meaning. "Then get your sword, if you can find it," he hissed back, his eyes 
black with menace. 


"Damon, Stefan, please! Please, no!" Katherine cried, putting herself between them, catching Stefan's 
arm. She looked from one to the other, her blue eyes wide with shock and bright with unshed tears. 
"Think of what you are saying. You are brothers." 


"By no fault of mine," Damon grated, making the words a curse. 


"But can you not make peace? For me, Damon... Stefan? Please." 


Part of Stefan wanted to melt at Katherine's desperate look, at her tears. But wounded pride and 
jealousy were too strong, and he knew his face was as hard, as unyielding, as Damon's. 


Page 98 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
"No," he said. "We cannot. It must be one or the other, Katherine. I will never share you with him." 


Katherine's hand fell away from his arm, and the tears fell from her eyes, great droplets that splashed 
onto the white gown. She caught her breath in a wrenching sob. Then, still weeping, she picked up her 
skirts and ran. 


. 
"And then Damon took the ring she had given him and put it on," Stefan said, his voice hoarse with use 
and emotion. "And he said to me, 'I'll have her yet, brother.' And then he walked away." He turned, 
blinking as if he'd come into a bright light from the dark, and looked at Elena. 


"And then Damon took the ring she had given him and put it on," Stefan said, his voice hoarse with use 
and emotion. "And he said to me, 'I'll have her yet, brother.' And then he walked away." He turned, 
blinking as if he'd come into a bright light from the dark, and looked at Elena. 


"And... what happened then?" 


Stefan's hands clenched violently, reflexively, and he jerked away from the window. Not that memory. 
He could not endure that memory himself, much less try to speak it. How could he do that? How could 
he take Elena down into that darkness and show her the terrible things lurking there? 


"No," he said. "I can't. I can't." 


"You have to tell me," she said softly. "Stefan, it's the end of the story, isn't it? That's what's behind all 
your walls, that's what you're afraid to let me see. But you must let me see it. Oh, Stefan, you can't stop 
now." 


He could feel the horror reaching for him, the yawning pit he had seen so clearly, felt so clearly that day 
long ago. The day when it had all ended-when it had all begun. 


He felt his hand taken, and when he looked he saw Elena's fingers closed about it, giving him warmth, 
giving him strength. Her eyes were on his. "Tell me." 


"You want to know what happened next, what became of Katherine?" he whispered. She nodded, her 
eyes nearly blind but still steady. "I'll tell you, then. She died the next day. My brother Damon and I, we 
killed her." 


Chapter Fourteen

Elena felt her flesh creep at the words. 


"You don't mean that," she said shakily. She remembered what she had seen on the roof, the blood 
smeared on Stefan's lips, and she forced herself not to recoil from him. "Stefan, I know you. You couldn't 
have done that..." 


He ignored her protestations, just went on staring with eyes that burned like the green ice at the bottom 
of a glacier. He was looking through her, into some incomprehensible distance. "As I lay in bed that night, 
I hoped against hope that she would come. Already I was noticing some of the changes in myself. I could

see better in the dark; it seemed I could hear better. I felt stronger than ever before, full of some 
elemental energy. And I was hungry. 

"It was a hunger I had never imagined. At dinner I found that ordinary food and drink did nothing to 
satisfy it. I couldn't understand that. And then I saw the white neck of one of the serving girls, and I knew 
why." He drew a long breath, his eyes dark and tortured. "That night, I resisted the need, though it took 
all my will. I was thinking of Katherine, and praying she would come to me. Praying!" He gave a short 
laugh. "If a creature like me can pray." 


Elena's fingers were numb within his grasp, but she tried to tighten them, to send him reassurance. "Go 
on, Stefan." 

Elena's fingers were numb within his grasp, but she tried to tighten them, to send him reassurance. "Go 
on, Stefan." 

"The next morning the need was stronger. It was as if my own veins were dry and cracked, desperate for 
moisture. I knew that I couldn't stand it for long. 

"I went to Katherine's chambers. I meant to ask her, to plead with her-" His voice cracked. He paused 
and then went on. "But Damon was there already, waiting outside her rooms. I could see that he hadn't 
resisted the need. The glow of his skin, the spring in his step, told me that. He looked as smug as the cat 
who's had the cream. 

"But he hadn't had Katherine. 'Knock all you like,' he said to me, 'but the female dragon inside won't let 
you past. I've tried already. Shall we overpower her, you and I?' 

"I wouldn't answer him. The look on his face, that sly, self-satisfied look, repelled me. I pounded on that 
door to wake..." He faltered, and then gave another humorless laugh. "I was going to say, 'to wake the 
dead.' But the dead aren't so hard to wake after all, are they?" After a moment, he went on. 

"The maid, Gudren, opened the door. She had a face like a flat white plate, and eyes like black glass. I 
asked her if I could see her mistress. I expected to be told that Katherine was asleep, but instead Gudren 
just looked at me, then at Damon over my shoulder. 

" 'I would not tell him,' she said at last, 'but I will tell you. My lady Katerina is not within. She went out 
early this morning, to walk in the gardens. She said she had much need of thought.' 

"I was surprised. 'Early this morning?' I said. 

" 'Yes,' she replied. She looked at both Damon and me without liking. 'My mistress was very unhappy 
last night,' she said meaningfully. 'All night long, she wept.' 

"When she said that, a strange feeling came over me. It wasn't just shame and grief that Katherine should 
be so unhappy. It was fear. I forgot my hunger and weakness. I even forgot my enmity for Damon. I was 
filled with haste and a great driving urgency. I turned to Damon and told him that we had to find 
Katherine, and to my surprise he just nodded. 

"We began to search the gardens, calling Katherine's name. I remember just what everything looked like 
that day. The sun was shining on the high cypress trees and the pines in the garden. Damon and I hurried 
between them, moving more and more quickly, and calling. We kept calling her..."

L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
Elena could feel the tremors in Stefan's body, communicated to her through his tightly gripping fingers. He 
was breathing rapidly but shallowly. 

"We had almost reached the end of the gardens when I remembered a place that Katherine had loved. It 
was a little way out onto the grounds, a low wall beside a lemon tree. I started there, shouting for her. 
But as I got closer, I stopped shouting. I felt... a fear-a terrible premonition. And I knew I mustn't-
mustn't go-" 

"Stefan!" said Elena. He was hurting her, his fingers biting into her own, crushing them. The tremors 
racing through his body were growing, becoming shudders. "Stefan, please!" 

But he gave no sign that he heard her. "It was like-a nightmare-everything happening so slowly. I 


couldn't move-and yet I had to. I had to keep walking. With each step, the fear grew stronger. I could 
smell it. A smell like burned fat. I mustn't go there-I don't want to see it-" 

couldn't move-and yet I had to. I had to keep walking. With each step, the fear grew stronger. I could 
smell it. A smell like burned fat. I mustn't go there-I don't want to see it-" 

"I don't want to see it-but I can't help it. There's something white. Something white under the tree. Don't 
make me look at it!" 

"Stefan, Stefan, look at me!" 

He was beyond hearing. His words came in heaving spasms, as if he could not control them, could not 
get them out fast enough. "I can't go any closer-but I do. I see the tree, the wall. And that white. Behind 
the tree. White with gold underneath. And then I know, I know, and I'm moving toward it because it's 
her dress. Katherine's white dress. And I get around the tree and I see it on the ground and it's true. It's 
Katherine's dress,"-his voice rose and broke in unimaginable horror-"but Katherine isn't in it." 

Elena felt a chill, as if her body had been plunged into ice water. Her skin rose in goose-flesh, and she 
tried to speak to him but couldn't. He was rattling on as if he could keep the terror away if he kept on 
talking. 

"Katherine isn't there, so maybe it's all a joke, but her dress is on the ground and it's full of ashes. Like 
the ashes in the hearth, just like that, only these smell of burned flesh. They stink. The smell is making me 
sick and faint. Beside the sleeve of the dress is a piece of parchment. And on a rock, on a rock a little 
way away is a ring. A ring with a blue stone, Katherine's ring. Katherine's ring..." Suddenly, he called out 
in a terrible voice, "Katherine, what have you done?" Then he fell to his knees, releasing Elena's fingers at 
last, to bury his face in his hands. 

Elena held him as he was gripped by wracking sobs. She held his shoulders, pulling him to her lap. 
"Katherine took the ring off," she whispered. It was not a question. "She exposed herself to the sun." 

His harsh sobs went on and on, as she held him to the full skirts of the blue gown, stroking his quivering 
shoulders. She murmured nonsense meant to soothe him, pushing away her own horror. And, presently, 
he quieted and lifted his head. He spoke thickly, but he seemed to have returned to the present, to have 
come back.

L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
"The parchment was a note, for me and for Damon. It said she had been selfish, wanting to have both of 
us. It said-she couldn't bear to be the cause of strife between us. She hoped that once she was gone we 
would no longer hate each other. She did it to bring us together." 

"Oh, Stefan," whispered Elena. She felt burning tears fill her own eyes in sympathy. "Oh, Stefan, I'm so 
sorry. But don't you see, after all this time, that what Katherine did was wrong? It was selfish, even, and 
it was her choice. In a way, it had nothing to do with you, or with Damon." 

Stefan shook his head as if to shake off the truth of the words. "She gave her life... for that. We killed 
her." He was sitting up now. But his eyes were still dilated, great disks of black, and he had the look of a 
small bewildered boy. 

"Damon came up behind me. He took the note and read it. And then-I think he went mad. We were 
both mad. I had picked up Katherine's ring, and he tried to take it. He shouldn't have. We struggled. We 
said terrible things to each other. We each blamed the other for what had happened. I don't remember 
how we got back to the house, but suddenly I had my sword. We were fighting. I wanted to destroy that 


arrogant face forever, to kill him. I remember my father shouting from the house. We fought harder, to 
finish it before he reached us. 

arrogant face forever, to kill him. I remember my father shouting from the house. We fought harder, to 
finish it before he reached us. 

Elena stared, aghast, but he went on without pause. "I felt the pain of the steel, I felt it stab through me, 
deep, deep inside. All the way through, a hard thrust. And then the strength poured out of me and I fell. I 
lay there on the paved ground." 

He looked up at Elena and finished simply, "And that is how... I died." 

Elena sat frozen, as if the ice she'd felt in her chest earlier tonight had flooded out and trapped her. 

"Damon came and stood over me and bent down. I could hear my father's cries from far away, and 
screams from the household, but all I could see was Damon's face. Those black eyes that were like a 
moonless night. I wanted to hurt him for what he had done to me. For everything he had done to me, and 
to Katherine." Stefan was quiet a moment, and then he said, almost dreamily, "And so I lifted my sword 
and I killed him. With the last of my strength, I stabbed my brother through the heart." 

The storm had moved on, and through the broken window Elena could hear soft night noises, the chirp of 
crickets, the wind sifting through trees. In Stefan's room, it was very still. 

"I knew nothing more until I woke up in my tomb," said Stefan. He leaned back, away from her, and shut 
his eyes. His face was pinched and weary, but that awful childlike dreaminess was gone. 

"Both Damon and I had had just enough of Katherine's blood to keep us from truly dying. Instead we 
changed. We woke together in our tomb, dressed in our best clothing, laid on slabs side by side. We 
were too weak to hurt each other anymore; the blood had been just barely enough. And we were 
confused. I called to Damon, but he ran outside into the night. 

"Fortunately, we had been buried with the rings Katherine had given us. And I found her ring in my 
pocket." As if unconsciously, Stefan reached up to stroke the golden circlet. "I suppose they thought she 

02 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
had given it to me. 

"I tried to go home. That was stupid. The servants screamed at the sight of me and ran to fetch a priest. I 
ran, too. Into the only place where I was safe, into the dark. 

"And that is where I've stayed ever since. It's where I belong, Elena. I killed Katherine with my pride and 
my jealousy, and I killed Damon with my hatred. But I did worse than kill my brother. I damned him. 

"If he hadn't died then, with Katherine's blood so strong in his veins, he would have had a chance. In time 
the blood would have grown weaker, and then passed away. He would have become a normal human 
again. By killing him then, I condemned him to live in the night. I took away his only chance of salvation." 

Stefan laughed bitterly. "Do you know what the name Salvatore means in Italian, Elena? It means 
salvation, savior. I'm named that, and for St. Stephen, the first Christian martyr. And I damned my 
brother to hell." 

"No," said Elena. And then, in a stronger voice, she said, "No, Stefan. He damned himself. He killed you. 
But what happened to him after that?" 


"For a while he joined one of the Free Companies, ruthless mercenaries whose business was to rob and 
plunder. He wandered across the country with them, fighting and drinking the blood of his victims. 

"For a while he joined one of the Free Companies, ruthless mercenaries whose business was to rob and 
plunder. He wandered across the country with them, fighting and drinking the blood of his victims. 

"He was stronger than I, because he was drinking human blood. And killing. Humans have the strongest 
life essence, and their blood gives power. And when they're killed, somehow the life essence they give is 
strongest of all. It's as if in those last moments of terror and struggle the soul is the most vibrant. Because 
Damon killed humans, he was able to draw on the Powers more than I was." 

"What... powers?" said Elena. A thought was growing in her mind. 

"Strength, as you said, and quickness. A sharpening of all the senses, especially at night. Those are the 
basics. We can also... feel minds. We can sense their presence, and sometimes the nature of their 
thoughts. We can cast confusion about weaker minds, either to overwhelm them or to bend them to our 
will. There are others. With enough human blood we can change our shapes, become animals. And the 
more you kill, the stronger all the Powers become." 

"Damon's voice in my mind was very strong. He said he was now the condottieri of his own ' company 
and he was coming back to Florence. He said that if I was there when he arrived he would kill me. I 
believed him, and I left. I've seen him once or twice since then. The threat is always the same, and he's 
always more powerful. Damon's made the most of his nature, and he seems to glory in its darkest side." 

"But it's my nature, too. The same darkness is inside me. I thought that I could conquer it, but I was 
wrong. That's why I came here, to Fell's Church. I thought if I settled in some small town, far away from 
the old memories, I might escape the darkness. And instead, tonight, I killed a man." 

"No," said Elena forcefully. "I don't believe that, Stefan." His story had filled her with horror and pity... 
and fear, too. She admitted that. But her disgust had vanished, and there was one thing she was sure 
about. Stefan wasn't a murderer. "What happened tonight, Stefan? Did you argue with Tanner?" 

03 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
"I... don't remember," he said bleakly. "I used the Power to persuade him to do what you wanted. Then 
I left. But later I felt the dizziness and the weakness come over me. As it has before." He looked up at 
her directly. "The last time it happened was in the cemetery, right by the church, the night Vickie Bennett 
was attacked." 

"But you didn't do that. You couldn't have done that... Stefan?" 

"I don't know," he said harshly. "What other explanation is there? And I did take blood from the old man 
under the bridge, that night you girls ran away from the graveyard. I would have sworn I didn't take 
enough to harm him, but he almost died. And I was there when both Vickie and Tanner were attacked." 

"But you don't remember attacking them," said Elena, relieved. The idea that had been growing in her 
mind was now almost a certainty. 

"What difference does it make? Who else could have done it, if not me?" 

"Damon," said Elena. 

He flinched, and she saw his shoulders tighten again. "It's a nice thought. I hoped at first that there might 
be some explanation like that. That it might be someone else, someone like my brother. But I've searched 
with my mind and found nothing, no other presence. The simplest explanation is that I'm the killer." 


"No," said Elena, "you don't understand. I don't just mean that someone like Damon might do the things 
we've seen. I mean Damon is here, in Fell's Church. I've seen him." 

"No," said Elena, "you don't understand. I don't just mean that someone like Damon might do the things 
we've seen. I mean Damon is here, in Fell's Church. I've seen him." 

"It must be him," Elena said, taking a deep breath. "I've seen him twice now, maybe three times. Stefan, 
you just told me a long story, and now I've got one to tell you." 

As quickly and simply as she could, she told him about what had happened in the gym, and at Bonnie's 
house. His lips tightened into a white line as she told him how Damon had tried to kiss her. Her cheeks 
grew hot as she remembered her own response, how she had almost given in to him. But she told Stefan 
everything. 

About the crow, too, and all the other strange things that had happened since she had come home from 
France. 

"And, Stefan, I think Damon was at the Haunted House tonight," she finished. "Just after you felt dizzy in 
the front room, someone passed me. He was dressed up like-like Death, in black robes and a hood, 
and I couldn't see his face. But something about the way he moved was familiar. It was him, Stefan. 
Damon was there." 

"But that still wouldn't explain the other times. Vickie and the old man. I did take blood from the old 
man." Stefan's face was taut, as if he were almost afraid to hope. 

"But you said yourself you didn't take enough to harm him. Stefan, who knows what happened to that 
man after you left? Wouldn't it be the easiest thing in the world for Damon to attack him then? Especially 

04 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
if Damon's been spying on you all along, maybe in some other form..." 

"Like a crow," murmured Stefan. 

"Like a crow. And as for Vickie... Stefan, you said that you can cast confusion over weaker minds, 
overpower them. Couldn't that be what Damon was doing to you? Overpowering your mind as you can 
overpower a human's?" 


"Yes, and shielding his presence from me." There was mounting excitement in Stefan's voice. "That's why 
he hasn't answered my calls. He wanted-" 


"He wanted just what's happened to happen. He wanted you to doubt yourself, to think you were a 
killer. But it isn't true, Stefan. Oh, Stefan, you know that now, and you don't have to be afraid 
anymore." She stood up, feeling joy and relief course through her. Out of this hideous night, something 
wonderful had come. 


"That's why you've been so distant with me, isn't it?" she said, holding out her hands to him. "Because 
you're afraid of what you might do. But there's no need for that any longer." 


"Isn't there?" He was breathing quickly again, and he eyed her outstretched hands as if they were two 
snakes. "You think there's no reason to be afraid? Damon may have attacked those people, but he 
doesn't control my thoughts. And you don't know what I've thought about you." 


Elena kept her voice level. "You don't want to hurt me," she said positively. 


"No? There have been times, watching you in public, when I could scarcely bear not to touch you. When 
I was so tempted by your white throat, your little white throat with the faint blue veins beneath the skin... 
" His eyes were fixed on her neck in a way that reminded her of Damon's eyes, and she felt her heartbeat

step up. "Times when I thought I would grab you and force you right there in the school." 


step up. "Times when I thought I would grab you and force you right there in the school." 


He swallowed thickly. "You don't know what you're asking for." 


"I think I do. You told me how it was with Katherine, Stefan. I want it to be like that with us. I don't 
mean I want you to change me. But we can share a little without that happening, can't we? I know," she 
added, even more softly, "how much you loved Katherine. But she's gone now, and I'm here. And I love 
you, Stefan. I want to be with you." 


"You don't know what you're talking about!" He was standing rigid, his face furious, his eyes anguished. 
"If I once let go, what's to keep me from changing you, or killing you? The passion is stronger than you 
can imagine. Don't you understand yet what I am, what I can do?" 


She stood there and looked at him quietly, her chin raised slightly. It seemed to enrage him. 


"Haven't you seen enough yet? Or do I have to show you more? Can't you picture what I might do to 
you?" He strode over to the cold fireplace and snatched out a long piece of wood, thicker than both 
Elena's wrists together. With one motion, he snapped it in two like a match stick. "Your fragile bones," he 
said. 


05 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
Across the room was a pillow from the bed; he caught it up and with a slash of his nails left the silk cover 
in ribbons. "Your soft skin." Then he moved toward Elena with preternatural quickness; he was there and 
had hold of her shoulders before she knew what was happening. He scared into her face a moment, then, 
with a savage hiss that raised the hairs at the nape of her neck, drew his lips back. 


It was the same snarl she'd seen on the roof, those white teeth bared, the canines grown to unbelievable 
length and sharpness. They were the fangs of a predator, a hunter. "Your white neck," he said in a 
distorted voice. 


Elena stood paralyzed another instant, gazing as if compelled into that chilling visage, and then something 
deep in her unconscious took over. She reached up within the restraining circle of his arms and caught his 
face between her two hands. His cheeks were cool against her palms. She held him that way, softly, so 
softly, as if to reprove his hard grip on her bare shoulders. And she saw the confusion slowly come to his 
face, as he realized she was not doing it to fight him or to shove him away. 


Elena waited until that confusion reached his eyes, shattering his gaze, becoming almost a look of 
pleading. She knew that her own face was fearless, soft yet intense, her lips slightly parted. They were 
both breathing quickly now, together, in rhythm. Elena could feel it when he started to shake, trembling as 
he had when the memories of Katherine had become too much to bear. Then, very gently and 
deliberately, she drew that snarling mouth down to her own. 


He tried to oppose her. But her gentleness was stronger than all his inhuman strength. She shut her eyes 
and thought only of Stefan, not of the dreadful things she had learned tonight but of Stefan, who had 
stroked her hair as lightly as if she might break in his hands. She thought of that, and she kissed the 
predatory mouth that had threatened her a few minutes ago. 


She felt the change, the transformation in his mouth as he yielded, responding helplessly to her, meeting 
her soft kisses with equal softness. She felt the shudder go through Stefan's body as the hard grip on her 
shoulders softened, too, becoming an embrace. And she knew she'd won. 


. 
"You will never hurt me," she whispered. 


"You will never hurt me," she whispered. 


Gradually, the kisses grew more urgent, and Elena felt the summer lightning flicker all through her body, 
charging it, making her heart pound and her breath catch. It made her feel strangely soft and dizzy, made 
her shut her eyes and let her head fall back in abandon. 


It's time, Stefan, she thought. And, very gently, she drew his mouth down again, this time to her throat. 
She felt his lips graze her skin, felt his breath warm and cool at once. Then she felt the sharp sting. 


But the pain faded almost instantly. It was replaced by a feeling of pleasure that made her tremble. A 
great rushing sweetness filled her, flowing through her to Stefan. 


At last she found herself gazing into his face, into a face that at last had no barriers against her, no walls. 
And the look she saw there made her feel weak. 


"Do you trust me?" he whispered. And when she simply nodded, he held her eyes and reached for 
something beside the bed. It was the dagger. She regarded it without fear, and then fixed her eyes again 


06 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
on his face. 
He never looked away from her as he unsheathed it and made a small cut at the base of his throat. Elena 


looked at it wide-eyed, at the blood as bright as holly berries, but when he urged her forward she did not 
try to resist him. 
Afterward he just held her a long time, while the crickets outside made their music. Finally, he stirred. 
"I wish you could stay here," he whispered. "I wish you could stay forever. But you can't." 
"I know," she said, equally quiet. Their eyes met again in silent communion. There was so much to say, so 


many reasons to be together. "Tomorrow," she said. Then, leaning against his shoulder, she whispered, 
"Whatever happens, Stefan, I'll be with you. Tell me you believe that." 
His voice was hushed, muffled in her hair. "Oh, Elena, I believe it. Whatever happens, we'll be together." 
Chapter Fifteen 
&laquo; ^ &raquo; 


As soon as he left Elena at her house, Stefan went to the woods. 
He took Old Creek Road, driving under the sullen clouds-through which no patch of sky could be seen, 
to the place where he had parked on the first day of school. 


Leaving the car, he tried to retrace his steps exactly to the clearing where he had seen the crow. His 
hunter's instincts helped him, recalling the shape of this bush and that knotted root, until he stood in the 
open place ringed with ancient oak trees. 


. 
Here. Under this blanket of dingy-brown leaves, some of the rabbit's bones might even remain. 


Here. Under this blanket of dingy-brown leaves, some of the rabbit's bones might even remain. 
And for the first time since he'd come to Fell's Church, he felt the flicker of a reply. But it seemed faint 
and wavering, and he could not locate it in space. 


He sighed and turned around-and stopped dead. 


Damon stood before him, arms crossed over his chest, lounging against the largest oak tree. He looked 
as if he might have been there for hours. 
"So," said Stefan heavily, "it is true. It's been a long time, brother." 
"Not as long as you think, brother." Stefan remembered that voice, that velvety, ironical voice. "I've kept 


track of you over the years," Damon said calmly. He flicked a bit of bark from the sleeve of his leather 
jacket as casually as he had once arranged his brocade cuffs. "But then, you wouldn't know that, would 
you? Ah, no, your Powers are as weak as ever." 

"Be careful, Damon," Stefan said softly, dangerously. "Be very careful tonight. I'm not in a tolerant 
mood." 

07 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
"St. Stefan in a pique? Imagine. You're distressed, I suppose, because of my little excursions into your 
territory. I only did it because I wanted to be close to you. Brothers should be close." 


"You killed tonight. And you tried to make me think I'd done it." 


"Are you quite sure you didn't? Perhaps we did it together. Careful!" he said as Stefan stepped toward 
him. "My mood is not the most tolerant tonight, either. I only had a wizened little history teacher; you had 
a pretty girl." 


The fury inside Stefan coalesced, seeming to focus in one bright burning spot, like a sun inside him. 
"Keep away from Elena," he whispered with such menace that Damon actually tilted his head back 
slightly. "Keep away from her, Damon. I know you've been spying on her, watching her. But no more. 
Go near her again and you'll regret it." 


"You always were selfish. Your one fault. Not willing to share anything, are you?" Suddenly, Damon's 
lips curved in a singularly beautiful smile. "But fortunately the lovely Elena is more generous. Didn't she tell 
you about our little liaisons? Why, the first time we met she almost gave herself to me on the spot." 


"That's a lie!" 


"Oh, no, dear brother. I never lie about anything important. Or do I mean unimportant? Anyway, your 
beauteous damsel nearly swooned into my arms. I think she likes men in black." As Stefan stared at him, 
trying to control his breathing, Damon added, almost gently, "You're wrong about her, you know. You 
think she's sweet and docile, like Katherine. She isn't. She's not your type at all, my saintly brother. She 
has a spirit and a fire in her that you wouldn't know what to do with." 


"And you would, I suppose." 


Damon uncrossed his arms and slowly smiled again. "Oh, yes." 


Stefan wanted to leap for him, to smash that beautiful, arrogant smile, to tear Damon's throat out. He 
said, in a barely controlled voice, "You're right about one thing. She's strong. Strong enough to fight you 


. 
off. And now that she knows what you really are, she will. All she feels for you now is disgust." 


off. And now that she knows what you really are, she will. All she feels for you now is disgust." 


Kill him, something in Stefan's mind demanded. Kill him, snap his neck, rip his throat to bloody shreds. 
But he knew Damon had fed very well tonight. His brother's dark aura was swollen, pulsing, almost 
shining with the life essence he had taken. 


"Yes, I drank deeply," Damon said pleasantly, as if he knew what was in Stefan's mind. He sighed and 
ran his tongue over his lips in satisfied remembrance. "He was small, but there was a surprising amount of 
juice in him. Not pretty like Elena, and he certainly didn't smell as good. But it's always exhilarating to feel 
the new blood singing inside you." Damon breathed expansively, stepping away from the tree and looking 
around. Stefan remembered those graceful movements, too, each gesture controlled and precise. The 
centuries had only refined Damon's natural poise. 


"It makes me feel like doing this," said Damon, moving to a sapling a few yards away. It was half again as 


08 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
tall as he was, and when he grasped it his fingers did not meet around the trunk. But Stefan saw the quick 
breath and the ripple of muscles under Damon's thin black shirt, and then the tree tore loose from the 
ground, its roots dangling. Stefan could smell the pungent dampness of disturbed earth. 

"I didn't like it there anyway," said Damon, and heaved it as far away as the still-entangled roots would 
allow. Then he smiled engagingly. "It also makes me feel like doing this." 

There was a shimmer of motion, and then Damon was gone. Stefan looked around but could see no sign 
of him. 

"Up here, brother." The voice came from overhead, and when Stefan looked up he saw Damon perching 
among the spreading branches of the oak tree. There was a rustle of tawny brown leaves, and he 
disappeared again. 

"Back here, brother." Stefan spun at the tap on his shoulder, only to see nothing behind him. "Right here, 
brother." He spun again. "No, try here." Furious, Stefan whipped the other way, trying to catch hold of 
Damon. But his fingers grasped only air. 

Here, Stefan. This time the voice was in his mind, and the Power of it shook him to the core. It took 
enormous strength to project thoughts that clearly. Slowly, he turned around once more, to see Damon 
back in his original position, leaning against the big oak tree. 

But this time the humor in those dark eyes had faded. They were black and fathomless, and Damon's lips 
were set in a straight line. 

What more proof do you need, Stefan? I'm as much stronger than you as you are stronger than 
these pitiful humans. I'm faster than you, too, and I have other Powers you've scarcely heard of. 
The Old Powers, Stefan. And I'm not afraid to use them. If you fight me, I'll use them against you. 

"Is that what you came here for? To torture me?" 

I've been merciful with you, brother. Many times you've been mine for the killing, but I've always 
spared your life. But this time is different. Damon stepped away from the tree again and spoke aloud. 
"I am warning you, Stefan, don't oppose me. It doesn't matter what I came here for. What I want now is 
Elena. And if you try to stop me from taking her, I will kill you." 


"You can try," said Stefan. The hot pinpoint of fury inside him burned brighter than ever, pouring forth its 
brilliance like a whole galaxy of stars. He knew, somehow, that it threatened Damon's darkness. 

"You can try," said Stefan. The hot pinpoint of fury inside him burned brighter than ever, pouring forth its 
brilliance like a whole galaxy of stars. He knew, somehow, that it threatened Damon's darkness. 

He lashed out savagely, trying to strike at the vulnerable area under Damon's jaw. It did no good; his 
arms were pinioned behind him, his body immobilized. He was as helpless as a bird under the claws of a 
lean and expert cat. 

He went limp for an instant, making himself a deadweight, and then he suddenly surged with all his 
muscles, trying to break free, trying to get a blow in. The cruel hands only tightened on him, making his 
struggles useless. Pathetic.

L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
You always were stubborn. Perhaps this will convince you. Stefan looked into his brother's face, pale 
as the frosted-glass windows at the boarding house, and at those black bottomless eyes. Then he felt 
fingers grasp his hair, jerk his head back, exposing his throat. 


His struggles redoubled, became frantic. Don't bother, came the voice in his head, and then he felt the 
sharp rending pain of teeth. He felt the humiliation and helplessness of the hunter's victim, of the hunted, 
of the prey. And then the pain of blood being drawn out against his will. 


He refused to give in to it, and the pain grew worse, a feeling as if his soul was tearing loose like the 
sapling. It stabbed through him like spears of fire, concentrating on the punctures in his flesh where 
Damon's teeth had sunk in. Agony flamed up his jaw and cheek and down his chest and shoulder. He felt 
a wave of vertigo and realized he was losing consciousness. 


Then, abruptly, the hands released him and he fell to the ground, onto a bed of damp and moldering oak 
leaves. Gasping for breath, he painfully got to his hands and knees. 


"You see, little brother, I'm stronger than you. Strong enough to take you, take your blood and your life if 
I wish it. Leave Elena to me, or I will." 


Stefan looked up. Damon was standing with head thrown back, legs slightly apart, like a conqueror 
putting his foot on the neck of the conquered. Those night-black eyes were hot with triumph, and Stefan's 
blood was on his lips. 


Hatred filled Stefan, such hatred as he had never known before. It was as if all his earlier hatred of 
Damon had been a drop of water to this crashing, foaming ocean. Many times in the last long centuries he 
had regretted what he had done to his brother, when he'd wished with all his soul to change it. Now he 
only wanted to do it again. 


"Elena is not yours," he ground out, getting to his feet, trying not to show what an effort it cost him. "And 
she never will be." Concentrating on each step, putting one foot in front of the other, he began walking 
away. His entire body hurt, and the shame he felt was even greater than the physical ache. There were 
bits of wet leaves and crumbs of earth adhering to his clothes, but he did not brush them off. He fought to 
keep moving, to hold out against the weakness that lapped at his limbs. 


You never learn, brother. 


Stefan did not look back or try to reply. He gritted his teeth and kept his legs moving. Another step. And 


. 
another step. And another step. 


another step. And another step. 


Another step, and another step. The car couldn't be far now. Leaves crackled under his feet, and then he 
heard leaves crackle behind him. 


He tried to turn quickly, but his reflexes were almost gone. And the sharp motion was too much for him. 
Darkness filled him, filled his body and his mind, and he was falling. He fell forever into the black of 
absolute night. And then, mercifully, he knew no more.

L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
&laquo; ^ 

Elena hurried toward Robert E. Lee, feeling as if she'd been away from it for years. Last night seemed 
like something from her distant childhood, barely remembered. But she knew that today there would be 
its consequences to face. 

Last night she'd had to face Aunt Judith. Her aunt had been terribly upset when neighbors had told her 
about the murder, and even more upset that no one seemed to know where Elena was. By the time Elena 
had arrived home at nearly two in the morning, she had been frantic with worry. 

Elena hadn't been able to explain. She could only say that she'd been with Stefan, and that she knew he 
had been accused, and that she knew was innocent. All the rest, everything else that had happened, she 
had had to keep to herself. Even if Aunt Judith had believed it, she would never have understood. 

And this morning Elena had slept in, and now she was late. The streets were deserted except for her, as 
she hurried on toward the school. Overhead,, the sky was gray and a wind was rising. She desperately 
wanted to see Stefan. All night, while she'd been sleeping so heavily, she'd had nightmares about him. 

One dream had been especially real. In it she saw Stefan's pale face and his angry, accusing eyes. He 
held up a book to her and said, "How could you, Elena? How could you?" Then he dropped the book at 
her feet and walked away. She called after him, pleading, but he went on walking until he disappeared in 
darkness. When she looked down at the book, she saw it was bound in dark blue velvet. Her diary. 

A quiver of anger went through her as she thought again of how her diary had been stolen. But what did 
the dream mean? What was in her diary to make Stefan look like that? 

She didn't know. All she knew was that she needed to see him, to hear his voice, to feel his arms around 
her. Being away from him was like being separated from her own flesh. 

She ran up the steps of the high school into the nearly empty corridors. She headed toward the 
foreign-language wing, because she knew that Stefan's first class was Latin. If she could just see him for a 
moment, she would be all right. 

But he wasn't in class. Through the little window in the door, she saw his empty seat. Matt was there, and 
the expression on his face made her feel more frightened than ever. He kept glancing at Stefan's desk 
with a look of sick apprehension. 


Elena turned away from the door mechanically. Like an automaton, she climbed the stairs and walked to 
her trigonometry classroom. As she opened the door, she saw every face turn toward her, and she 
slipped hastily into the empty desk beside Meredith.

Meredith reached over to take her hand. "Are you all right?" she whispered. 

"I don't know," said Elena stupidly. She felt as if the very air around her was smothering her, as if there 
were a crushing weight all around her. Meredith's fingers felt dry and hot. "Meredith, do you know what's 

11 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
happened to Stefan?" 

"You mean you don't know?" Meredith's dark eyes widened, and Elena felt the weight grow even more 
crushing. It was like being deep, deep under water without a pressure suit. 

"They haven't... arrested him, have they?" she said, forcing the words out. 

"Elena, it's worse than that. He's disappeared. The police went to the boarding house early this morning 
and he wasn't there. They came to school, too, but he never showed up today. They said they'd found his 
car abandoned out by Old Creek Road. Elena, they think he's left, skipped town, because he's guilty." 

"That's not true," said Elena through her teeth. She saw people turn around and look at her, but she was 
beyond caring. "He's innocent!" 

"I know you think so, Elena, but why else would he leave?" 

"He wouldn't. He didn't." Something was burning inside Elena, a fire of anger that pushed back at the 
crushing fear. She was breathing raggedly. "He would never have left of his own free will." 

"You mean someone forced him? But who? Tyler wouldn't dare-" 

"Forced him, or worse," Elena interrupted. The entire class was staring at them now, and Ms. Halpern 
was opening her mouth. Elena stood up suddenly, looking at them without seeing. "God help him if he's 
hurt Stefan," she said. "God help him." Then she whirled and made for the door. 

"Elena, come back! Elena!" She could hear shouts behind her, Meredith's and Ms. Halpern's. She 
walked on, faster and faster, seeing only what was straight ahead of her, her mind fixed on one thing. 

They thought she was going after Tyler Smallwood. Good. They could waste their time running in the 
wrong direction. She knew what she had to do. 

She left the school, plunging into the cold autumn air. She moved quickly, legs eating up the distance 
between the school and the Old Creek Road. From there she turned toward Wickery Bridge and the 
graveyard. 

An icy wind whipped her hair back and stung her face. Oak leaves were flying around her, swirling in the 
air. But the conflagration in her heart was searing hot and burned away the cold. She knew now what a 
towering rage meant. She strode past the purple beeches and the weeping willows into the center of the 
old graveyard and looked around her with feverish eyes. 

Above, the clouds were flowing along like a lead-gray river. The limbs of the oaks and beeches lashed 
together wildly. A gust threw handfuls of leaves into her face. It was as if the graveyard were trying to 
drive her out, as if it were showing her its power, gathering itself to do something awful to her. 


Elena ignored all of it. She spun around, her burning gaze searching between the headstones. Then she 
turned and shouted directly into the fury of the wind. Just one word, but the one she knew would bring 
him.

him.

The Vampire Diaries 
Volume II: THE STRUGGLE 
One 
"Damon!" 
Icy wind whipped Elena's hair around her face, tearing at her light sweater. Oak leaves swirled among 

the rows of granite headstones, and the trees lashed their branches together in a frenzy. Elena's hands 
were cold, her lips and cheeks numb, but she stood facing the screaming wind directly, shouting into it. 

"Damon!" 
This weather was a show of his power, meant to frighten her away. It wouldn't work. The thought of that 
same power being turned against Stefan woke a hot fury inside her that burned against the wind. If 
Damon had done anything to Stefan, if Damon had hurt him... 


"Damn you, answer me!" she shouted at the oak trees that bordered the graveyard. 
A dead leaf like a withered brown hand skittered up to her foot, but there was no answer. Above, the 
sky was gray as glass, gray as the tombstones which surrounded her. Elena felt rage and frustration sting 


her throat and she sagged. She'd been wrong. Damon wasn't here after all; she was alone with the 
screaming wind. 
She turned and gasped. 
He was just behind her, so close that her clothes brushed his as she turned. At that distance, she should 


have sensed another human being standing there, should have felt his body-warmth or heard him. But of 


course Damon wasn't human. 
She reeled back a couple of steps before she could stop herself. Every instinct that had lain quiet while 
she shouted into the violence of the wind was now begging her to run. 


She clenched her fists. "Where's Stefan?" 
A line appeared between Damon's dark eyebrows. "Stefan who?" 
. 


Elena stepped forward and slapped him. 
Elena stepped forward and slapped him. 
He was dressed as she had first seen him, in black. Soft black boots, black jeans, black sweater, and 


leather jacket. And he looked like Stefan. She didn't know how she could have missed that before. He 
had the same dark hair, the same pale skin, the same disturbing good looks. But his hair was straight, not 
wavy, and his eyes were black as midnight, and his mouth was cruel. 

13 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
He turned his head slowly back to look at her and she saw blood rising in the cheek she'd slapped. 


"Don't lie to me," she said, her voice shaking. "I know who you are. I know what you are. You killed 
Mr. Tanner last night. And now Stefan's disappeared." 
"Has he?" 
"You know he has!" 
Damon smiled, and then turned it off instantly. 
"I'm warning you; if you've hurt him-" 
"Then, what?" he said. "What will you do, Elena? What can you do, against me?" 
Elena fell silent. For the first time she realized that the wind had died away. The day had gone deadly 


quiet around them, as if they stood motionless at the center of some great circle of power. It seemed as if 
everything, the leaden sky, the oaks and purple beeches, the ground itself, was connected to him, as if he 
drew power from all of it. He stood with his head tilted back slightly, his eyes fathomless and full of 
strange lights. 

"I don't know," she whispered, "but I'll find something. Believe me." 
He laughed suddenly and Elena's heart jerked and began pounding hard. God, he was beautiful. 


Handsome was too weak and colorless a word. As usual, the laughter lasted only a moment, but even 
when his lips had sobered it left traces in his eyes. 
"I do believe you," he said, relaxing, looking around the graveyard. Then he turned back and held out a 

hand to her. "You're too good for my brother," he said casually. 
Elena thought of slapping the hand away, but she didn't want to touch him again. "Tell me where he is." 
"Later, possibly-for a price." He withdrew his hand. 
"My brother," he went on, "is a fool. He thinks that because you look like Katherine you're weak and 


easily led like her. But he's wrong. I could feel your anger from the other side of town. I can feel it now, a 
white light like the desert sun. You're strong, Elena, even as you are. But you could be so much stronger 
..." 

She stared at him, not understanding, not liking the change of subject. "I don't know what you're talking 

about. And what has it got to do with Stefan?" 
"I'm talking about power, Elena." Suddenly, he stepped close to her, his eyes fixed on hers, his voice soft 
and urgent. "You've tried everything else, and nothing has satisfied you. You're the girl who has 


everything, but there's always been something just out of your reach, something you need desperately and 
can't have. That's what I'm offering you. Power. Eternal life. And feelings you've never felt before." 

everything, but there's always been something just out of your reach, something you need desperately and 

14 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
can't have. That's what I'm offering you. Power. Eternal life. And feelings you've never felt before." 

"Why not?" he whispered. "Why not try it, Elena? Be honest, isn't there a part of you that wants to?" His 
dark eyes were full of a heat and intensity that held her transfixed, unable to look away. "I can waken 
things inside you that have been sleeping all your life. You're strong enough to live in the dark, to glory in 
it. You can become a queen of the shadows. Why not take that power, Elena? Let me help you take it." 

"No," she said, wrenching her eyes away from his. She wouldn't look at him, wouldn't let him do this to 
her. She wouldn't let him make her forget... make her forget... 

"It's the ultimate drug, Elena," he said. His voice was as caressing as the fingertips which touched her 
throat. "The ultimate secret. You'll be happy as never before." 

There was something terribly important she must remember. He was using Power to make her forget it, 
but she wouldn't let him make her forget... 

"And we'll be together, you and I." The cool fingertips stroked the side of her neck, slipping under the 
collar of her sweater. "Just the two of us, forever." 

There was a sudden twinge of pain as his fingers brushed two tiny wounds in the flesh of her neck there, 
and her mind cleared. 

Make her forget... Stefan. 

That was what he wanted to drive out of her mind. The memory of Stefan, of his green eyes and his smile 
that always had sadness lurking Behind it. But nothing could force Stefan out of her thoughts now, not 
after what they had shared. She pulled away from Damon, knocking those cool fingertips aside. She 
looked straight at him. 

"I've already found what I want," she said brutally. "And who I want to be with forever." 

Blackness welled up in his eyes, a cold rage that swept through the air between them. Looking into those 
eyes, Elena thought of a cobra about to strike. 

"Don't you be as stupid as my brother is," he said. "Or I might have to treat you the same way." 

She was frightened now, she couldn't help it, not with cold pouring into her, chilling her bones. The wind 
was picking up again, the branches tossing. "Tell me where he is, Damon." 

"At this moment? I don't know. Can't you stop thinking about him for an instant?" 

"No!" She shuddered, hair lashing about her face again. 

"And that's your final answer, today? Be very sure you want to play this game with me, Elena. The 
consequences are nothing to laugh about." 

"I am sure." She had to stop him before he got to her again. "And you can't intimidate me, Damon, or 
haven't you noticed? The moment Stefan told me what you were, what you'd done, you lost any power 
you might have had over me. I hate you. You disgust me. And there's nothing you can do to me, not any 
more." 

15 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
His face altered, the sensuousness twisting and freezing, becoming cruel and bitterly hard. He laughed, 


. 
but this laugh went on and on. "Nothing?" he said. "I can do anything to you. You have no idea, Elena, 
of what I can do. But you'll learn." 


but this laugh went on and on. "Nothing?" he said. "I can do anything to you. You have no idea, Elena, 
of what I can do. But you'll learn." 


"Winter is coming, Elena," he said, and his voice was clear and chilling even over the howl of the wind. 
"An unforgiving season. Before it's over you'll have learned what I can and can't do. Before winter is over 
you'll have joined me. You'll be mine." 


The swirling whiteness was blinding her and now even his voice was fading. She could no longer see the 
dark bulk of his figure. She hugged herself with her arms, head bent down, her whole body shaking. She 
whispered, "Stefan-" 


"Oh, and one more thing," his voice came back. "You asked earlier about my brother. Don't bother 
looking for him, Elena. I killed him last night." 


Her head jerked up, but there was nothing to see, only the dizzying whiteness, which burned her nose 
and cheeks and clogged her eyelashes. It was only then, as the fine grains settled on her skin that she 
realized what they were. 


Snowflakes. It was snowing on the first of November. Overhead, the sun was gone. 


Two 


An unnatural twilight hung over the abandoned graveyard. Snow blurred Elena's eyes and the wind 
numbed her body as if she'd stepped into a current of ice water. Nevertheless, stubbornly, she did not 
turn around toward the modern cemetery and the road beyond it. As best she could judge, Wickery 
Bridge was straight in front of her. She headed for that. 


The police had found Stefan's abandoned car by the Old Creek Road. That meant he'd left it somewhere 
between Drowning Creek and the woods. Elena stumbled on the overgrown path through the graveyard, 
but she kept moving, head down, arms hugging her light sweater to her. She had been born in Fell's 
Church, she had known this graveyard all her life, and she could find her way through it blind. 


By the time she crossed the bridge her shivering had become painful. It wasn't snowing as hard now, but 
the wind was even worse. It cut through her clothes as if they were made of tissue paper, and took her 
breath away. 


Stefan, she thought, and turned onto Old Creek Road, trudging northward. She didn't believe what 
Damon had said. If Stefan were dead she would know. He was alive, somewhere, and she had to find 
him. He could be anywhere out in this swirling whiteness, he could be hurt, freezing. Dimly, Elena sensed 
that she wasn't rational any longer. All her thoughts had narrowed down to one single idea. Stefan. Find 
Stefan. 


It was getting harder to keep to the road. On her right were oak trees, on her left, the swift waters of 
Drowning Creek. She staggered and slowed. The wind didn't seem quite so bad anymore, but she did 
feel very tired. She needed to sit down and rest, just for a minute. 


16 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
As she sank down beside the road she suddenly realized how silly she had been to go out searching for 


Stefan. Stefan would come to her. All she needed to do was sit here and wait. He was probably coming 
right now. 

Stefan. Stefan would come to her. All she needed to do was sit here and wait. He was probably coming 
right now. 

But then instead of holding her, Stefan was shaking her. He was ruining the beautiful tranquility of her 
rest. She saw his face, pale and urgent, his green eyes dark with pain. She tried to tell him to be still, but 
he wouldn't listen. 

Elena, get up, he said, and she felt the compelling force of those green eyes willing her to do it. 

Elena, get up now-

"Elena, get up!" The voice was high and thin and frightened. "Come on, Elena! Get up! We can't carry 
you!" 

Blinking, Elena brought a face into focus. 

"Bonnie," she said slowly. "What are you doing here?" 

"Helping me look for you," said a second, lower voice, on Elena's other side. She turned slightly. 
Meredith's dark eyes, usually so ironic, were worried now, too. "Stand up, Elena, unless you want to 
become an Ice Princess for real." 

There was snow all over her. Stiffly, Elena stood, leaning heavily on the two other girls. They walked her 
back to Meredith's car. 

It should have been warmer inside the car, but Elena's nerve endings were coming back to life, telling her 
how cold she really was. Winter is an unforgiving season, she thought, as Meredith drove. 

Aunt Judith was waiting inside, with blankets. "I knew if they found you you'd be half-frozen," she said in 
a determinedly cheerful voice as she reached for Elena. "Snow on the day after Halloween! I can hardly 
believe it. Where did you girls find her?" 

"On the Old Creek Road, past the bridge," said Meredith. 

Aunt Judith's thin face lost color. "Near the graveyard? Where the attacks were? Elena, how could you 
..." Her voice trailed off as she looked at Elena. "We won't say anything more about it right now," she 
said, trying to regain her cheerful manner. "Let's get you out of those wet clothes." 

"I have to go back once I'm dry," said Elena. Her brain was working again and one thing was clear. She 
hadn't really seen Stefan out there; it had been a dream. Stefan was still missing. 

"You have to do nothing of the kind," said Robert, Aunt Judith's fianc... Elena had scarcely noticed him 
until then, standing quietly to one side. But his tone brooked no argument. "The police are looking for 
Stefan, you leave them to their job," he said. 

17 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
"The police think he killed Mr. Tanner. But he didn't. You know that, don't you?" As Aunt Judith pulled 
her sodden outer sweater off, Elena looked from one face to another for help, but they were all the same. 
"You know he didn't do it," she repeated, almost desperately. 


There was a silence. "Elena," Meredith said at last, "no one wants to think he did. But-well, it looks 
bad, his running away like this." 

There was a silence. "Elena," Meredith said at last, "no one wants to think he did. But-well, it looks 
bad, his running away like this." 

"Elena, hush," said Aunt Judith. "Don't get yourself worked up. I think you must be getting sick, it was so 
cold out there, and you only got a few hours of sleep last night..." She laid a hand on Elena's cheek. 

"I'm not sick," she cried, pulling away. "And I'm not crazy, either, whatever you think. Stefan didn't run 
away and he didn't kill Mr. Tanner, and I don't care if none of you believes me..." She Stopped, 
choking. Aunt Judith was fussing around her, hurrying her upstairs, and she let herself be hurried. But she 
wouldn't go to bed when Aunt Judith suggested she must be tired. Instead, she sat on the living room 
couch, by the fireplace, with blankets heaped around her. The phone rang all afternoon, and she heard 
Aunt Judith talking to friends, neighbors, the school. She assured all of them that Elena was fine. The-
the tragedy last night had unsettled her a bit, that was all, and she seemed a little feverish. But she'd be 
good as new after a rest. 

Meredith and Bonnie sat beside her. "Do you want to talk?" Meredith said in a low voice. Elena shook 
her head, staring into the fire. They were all against her. And Aunt Judith was wrong; she wasn't fine. She 
wouldn't be fine until Stefan was found. 

Meredith and Bonnie and Aunt Judith and Robert tried to make conversation while they ate an early 
supper sitting by the fire. Elena couldn't eat and wouldn't talk. The only one who wasn't miserable was 
Elena's little sister Margaret. With four-year-old optimism she cuddled up to Elena and offered her some 
of her Halloween candy. Elena hugged her hard, face pressed into Margaret's white-blond hair for a 
moment. If Stefan could have called her or gotten a message to her he would have done it by now. 
Nothing in the world would have stopped him, unless he were badly hurt, or trapped somewhere, or... 

She wouldn't let herself think about that last "or." Stefan was alive, he had to be alive. Damon was a liar. 

But Stefan was in trouble, and she had to find him somehow. She worried about it all through the 
evening, desperately trying to come up with a plan. One thing was clear; she was on her own. She 
couldn't trust anyone. 

It grew dark. Elena shifted on the couch and forced a yawn. 

"I'm tired," she said quietly. "Maybe I am sick, after all. I think I'll go to bed." 

Meredith was looking at her keenly. "I was just thinking, Miss Gilbert," she said, turning to Aunt Judith, 
"that maybe Bonnie and I should stay the night. To keep Elena company." 

"What a good idea," said Aunt Judith, pleased. "As long as your parents don't mind, I'd be glad to have 
you." 

18 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
"It's a long drive back to Herron. I think I'll stay, too," Robert said. "I can just stretch out on the couch 
here." Elena sat stonily, after looking once from the couch to the hall where the front door stood plainly in 
view. They'd planned this between them, or at least they were all in on it now. They were making sure 
she didn't leave the house. 


When she emerged from the bathroom a little while later, wrapped in her red silk kimono, she found 
Meredith and Bonnie sitting on her bed. 


"Well, hello, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern," she said bitterly. 


. 
Bonnie, who had been looking depressed, now looked alarmed. She glanced at Meredith doubtfully. 


Bonnie, who had been looking depressed, now looked alarmed. She glanced at Meredith doubtfully. 


"I don't know. Can I?" 


"Yes, because we're your friends." Before Elena could move Meredith jumped off the bed and shut the 
door. Then she turned to face Elena. "Now, for once in your life listen to me, you little idiot. It's true we 
don't know what to think about Stefan. But, don't you see, that's your own fault. Ever since you and he 
got together you've been shutting us out. Things have been happening that you haven't told us about. At 
least you haven't told us the whole story. But in spite of that, in spite of everything, we still trust you. We 
still care about you. We're still behind you, Elena, and we want to help. And if you can't see that, then 
you are an idiot." 


Slowly, Elena looked from Meredith's dark, intense face to Bonnie's pale one. Bonnie nodded. 


"It's true," she said, blinking hard as if to, keep back tears. "Even if you don't like us, we still like you." 


Elena felt her own eyes fill. "I'm sorry if I haven't been talking to you," she said. "I know you don't 
understand, and I can't even explain why I can't tell you anything. I just can't. But there's one thing I can 
tell you." She stepped back, wiping her cheeks, and looked at them earnestly. "No matter how bad the 
evidence against Stefan looks, he didn't kill Mr. Tanner. I know he didn't, because I know who did. 
And it's the same person who attacked Vickie, and the old man under the bridge." 


Bonnie shook her head dazedly. Meredith said, "Why don't you tell the police?" 


Elena's laugh was slightly hysterical. "I can't. It's not something they can deal with. And that's another 
thing I can't explain. You said you still trusted me; well, you'll just have to trust me about that." 


Bonnie and Meredith looked at one another, then at the bedspread, where Elena's nervous fingers were 
picking a thread out of the embroidery. Finally Meredith said, "All right. What can we do to help?" 


"I don't know. Nothing, unless..." Elena stopped and looked at Bonnie. "Unless," she said, in a changed 
voice, "you can help me find Stefan." 


Bonnie's brown eyes were genuinely bewildered. "Me? But what can I do?" Then at Meredith's indrawn 
breath, she said, "Oh. Oh." 


"You knew where I was that day I went to the cemetery," said Elena. "And you even predicted Stefan's 
coming to school."

"I thought you didn't believe in all that psychic stuff," said Bonnie weakly. 


"I've learned a thing or two since then. Anyway, I'm willing to believe anything if it'll help find Stefan. If 
there's any chance at all it will help." 


Bonnie was hunching up, as if trying to make her already tiny form as small as possible. "Elena, you don't 
understand," she said wretchedly. "I'm not trained, it's not something I can control. And... and it's not a 
game, not anymore. The more you use those powers, the more they use you. Eventually, they can end up 
using you all the time, whether you want it or not. It's dangerous." 


Elena got up and walked to the cherrywood dresser, looking down at it without seeing it. At last she 
turned. 


. 
"You're right; it's not a game. And I believe you about how dangerous it can be. But it's not a game for 
Stefan, either. Bonnie, I think he's out there, somewhere, terribly hurt. And there's nobody to help him, 
nobody's even looking for him, except his enemies. He may be dying right now. He-he may even be..." 
Her throat closed. She bowed her head over the dresser and made herself take a deep breath, trying to 
steady herself. When she looked up she saw Meredith was looking at Bonnie.

Her throat closed. She bowed her head over the dresser and made herself take a deep breath, trying to 
steady herself. When she looked up she saw Meredith was looking at Bonnie. 


"We need a candle," was all she said. 


The match rasped and threw sparks in the darkness, and then the candle flame burned strong and bright. 
It lent a golden glow to Bonnie's pale face as she bent over it. 


"I'm going to need both of you to help me focus," she said. "Look into the flame and think about Stefan. 
Picture him in your mind. No matter what happens, keep on looking at the flame. And whatever you do, 
don't say anything." 


Elena nodded, and then the only sound in the room was soft breathing. Stefan, thought Elena, gazing into 
the flame, trying to pour all her will into the thought. She created him in her mind, using all her senses, 
conjuring him to her. The roughness of his woolen sweater under her cheek, the smell of his leather 
jacket, the strength of his arms around her. Oh, Stefan... 


Bonnie's lashes fluttered and her breathing quickened, like a sleeper having a bad dream. Elena resolutely 
kept her eyes on the flame, but when Bonnie broke the silence a chill went up her spine. 


At first it was just a moan, the sound of someone in pain. Then, as Bonnie tossed her head, breath 
coming in short bursts, it became words. 


"Alone..." she said, and stopped. Elena's nails bit into her hand. "Alone... in the dark," said Bonnie. Her 
voice was distant and tortured. 


There was another silence, and then Bonnie began to speak quickly. 


20 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
"It's so dark and cold. And I'm alone. There's something behind me... jagged and hard. Rocks. They 
used to hurt-but not now. I'm numb now, from the cold. So cold..." Bonnie twisted, as if trying to get 
away from something, and then she laughed, a dreadful laugh almost like a sob. "That's-funny. I never 
thought I'd want to see the sun so much. But it's always dark here. And cold. Water up to my neck, like 
ice. That's funny, too. Water everywhere-and me dying of thirst. So thirsty... hurts..." 


Elena felt something tighten around her heart. Bonnie was inside Stefan's thoughts, and who knew what 
she might discover there? Stefan, tell us where you are, she thought desperately. Look around, tell me 
what you see. 


"Thirsty. I need... life?" Bonnie's voice was doubtful, as if not sure how to translate some concept. "I'm 
weak. He said I'll always be the weak one. He's strong... a killer. But that's what I am, too. I killed 
Katherine; maybe I deserve to die. Why not just let go..." 


"No!" said Elena, before she could stop herself. "Stefan-" 


"Elena!" Meredith cried sharply at the same time. But Bonnie's head fell forward, the flow of words cut 
off. Horrified, Elena realized what she had done. 


. 
"Bonnie, are you all right? Can you find him again? I didn't mean to..." 


"Bonnie, are you all right? Can you find him again? I didn't mean to..." 


"Elena," the voice said, "don't go to the bridge. It's death, Elena. Death is waiting there." Then Bonnie 
slumped bonelessly. 


Elena grabbed her shoulders and shook. "Bonnie!" she almost screamed. "Bonnie!"

I. O. U. 
One 
Midnight. There was no moon, and the stars were gone. Silence clung to her. For a heartbeat, Sharon 
did not know where she was. Then, as a chill wind ruffled her hair, she recognized the woods. 

The nightmare was back again. 

She looked around, feeling the panic began as a dull throb in her chest. The same dead trees, branches 
clawing for the skies: leafless, lifeless, but somehow malicious. Like skeletons with evil eyes, all watching 
her. The ground underfoot was herd and dry. Any grasses or flowers had died and withered long ago. All 
that were left were roots and stones, all cold, hard, and warning for her to begin to run. 

Sharon's heart began to pound, and she could feel the adrenaline pumping. Her breaths were short, 
forming trails of mist about her face. She wore only her nightdress, as always, and the air was cold and 
damp. Despite this, a thin trickle of sweat crawled down her back. She rubbed at it, feeling her hand go 
clammy at the touch. Her gaze darted about her, but nothing moved-yet. 

21 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
This was the way that it always began. And it always ended the same way, with her-

A sound! 

She twisted around, vainly trying to make out something, anything, in those disjointed trees. She tried to 
call out, but her throat wouldn't obey her mind. She could feel her heart speeding up, pounding. Her 
breath hissed in and out of her nostrils, the only thing she could now hear. Wildly, she darted her eyes all 
across the eerie landscape. Nothing. 

Wavering, she took a step backward. Her ankle caught on a root, and she almost lost her balance. She 


looked down, but there was nothing to see. She could barely make out the white shape of her naked 
feet. 

looked down, but there was nothing to see. She could barely make out the white shape of her naked 
feet. 

Sharon knew it, even though she couldn't see them. They had arrived, and were there, in the woods, 
somewhere. The man, the dark man, with his brooding eyes and slow, steady tread. And... the other. 
The un-man, the shapeless thing that plucked at the edge of her mind and refused ever to be seen. 

Backing up another step, something grabbed at her long, blonde hair. This time she found her voice, and 
screamed, pulling forward. The twigs from the tree jerked free from her hair, as she spun to face her 
attacker. Just a tree. 

This time. 

Again, she felt that they were watching her, waiting for her nerve to break. Waiting for her to run. But this 
time, she wouldn't do it. This time she would be strong. She wrapped her right arm about her chest, as if 
pulling a cloak over her flimsy clothing. The chill from the ground was numbing her toes. Wriggling them, 
she tried to fight off the cold. Slowly, hesitantly, feeling ahead with her extended left hand, she started to 
walk. She would not run! Not this time. 

Her fingers touched something cold, clammy, and alive. With a start, she drew back. Nothing happened, 
but she could feel something icky on her fingertips. She peered ahead, and could make out some sort of 
fungus growth on a tree. She had put her hand into that. Ugh! Her fingers felt filthy, contaminated, but 
there was nowhere to wipe them except her filmy nightgown. She didn't want to do that, and get the 
gross stuff even closer to her body. What could she do? 

She could feel their eyes, watching, waiting, looking for her reaction. Trying to stay rational, Sharon bent 
down in the darkness, feeling out with her itching left hand for something, anything. Her fingers closed on 
something hard and rounded. As she started to rub the fungus-stuff onto whatever it was, the object 
suddenly came to life, skittering away from her. With a scream, she shot back upright, her chest heaving. 
Without conscious thought, she pulled her left hand close, smearing her fingers onto the gown. 

Terrific. She could sense the contaminated spot, where it touched her thigh. It made her skin crawl, just 
knowing it was there. And she could smell the stuff now, a rancid odor of decay, sickly, and growing 
stronger. 

22 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
She took a step forward, but of course the smell moved with her. It was the stench of death, she knew, 
of something rotting, and she had touched it... 

The icy caress of the breeze stirred at her again, slipping beneath her nightdress and brushing her skin. A 
shock passed up her body, and she shivered. It was impossible to get warm. 

Unless she ran. And she wouldn't do that. 

Something crawled across her foot. Something chittering, with dozens of tiny, fast-moving feet. She 
screamed, and tried to kick it away. Something else, wavering, hesitant, reached out to touch her other 
foot. She spun around, choking back tears, and bony fingers grabbed her hair. She'd backed into the grip 
of one of the trees! With a sob, she pulled herself free. 

The scampering things in the darkness started to move again, and her skin crawled. Insects, bugs, all after 
her because she was warm and the only living thing in these woods. 

Forgetting her resolve, Sharon turned and ran. 


She tried to protect her face from the stinging blows of the branches and twigs. She could feel the lashing 
of these icy fingers, and she was getting scratched and bruised. She felt the trickling of blood now, mixing 
with the film of sweat. Her feet pounded across the uneven ground, stumbling over the rocks and roots 
that tried to grab at her and pull her down to the dead soil. Her breathing was short, hard, burning pants 
now, as she strove to fight down the terror welling up within.

that tried to grab at her and pull her down to the dead soil. Her breathing was short, hard, burning pants 
now, as she strove to fight down the terror welling up within. 

Her chest and lungs burned with every short, coughing breath she took. She could feel the punishment the 
soles of her feet were taking as she ran across the jagged stones and twisting roots. Arms flailing, she ran, 
the terror growing within her. She wanted to scream, but she had no breath to spare for that. 

It was a hunt, she knew: her pursuers were in no rush. They wanted her exhausted, ready to break, 
before they closed in. But knowing it and being able to do anything to fight it were not the same thing. 
After all, she knew that this was a dream, but the terror and the lacerations felt very real indeed. 

Finally, she could go on no more. For one last time, she stumbled, and now she fell. She couldn't even 
feel the extra pain as she crashed to the ground. She did manage to force one arm under her shaking 
body, and levered herself into a sitting position beneath a skeletal tree. The branches over her head felt 
the bars of a cage, and she knew that she was trapped. 

Every breath she took burned clear down to her stomach, and she could never take in enough air. She 
brushed the long hairs from her eyes, and stared out into the darkness. 

He was there, watching. Though there was no real light, she could see something burning redly in his eyes 
as he stared at her. It was the same man as always-tall, dark, with long, untidy hair flapping in the 
breeze. His skin was pale, his red eyes sunken. She took all of this in without thinking, because her eyes 
were drawn to the blade he held. 

23 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
It wasn't a normal knife. It was more like a cake knife, with a narrow blade that flattened out, then came 
to a sharp point. Dimly, she knew she had seen something like this knife before, and that it was 
important. But she couldn't place it. Besides which, this wasn't the time for cold, analytical thought. 


This was when she died. 


A slow smile crossed the man's face, twisting it unevenly. He had caught her thought, could scent her 
panic and utter weariness. He took a step forward, and she tried to crawl away. But the tree behind her 
held her firm. The blade rose, ready. 


If it was only death that she had to face, she would almost welcome it at this point. The panic had built to 
fever pitch, and she knew that dying of fright wasn't simply an expression. The thumping of her heart 
against her rib cage told her that it was almost ready to burst. But death was only the start of it... 


Behind her killer, still hardly there, was the Unseen. It lurked, just on the edges of vision, shifting, 
hungering, waiting. It was the force behind the man, the predator waiting for its next victim to be 
delivered. It was ravenous, waiting to devour her, body and soul. 


Death would be only the beginning of her agonies. 


The knife rose, as the man stepped forward. She flung her hand out, a futile gesture she was unable to 


. 
halt. He laughed, and grabbed at her wrist. She cried aloud with the pain as he forced her arm aside, 
exposing her chest. Then, in a frenzy of movement, he struck, plunging that glittering blade straight for 
her. 


halt. He laughed, and grabbed at her wrist. She cried aloud with the pain as he forced her arm aside, 
exposing her chest. Then, in a frenzy of movement, he struck, plunging that glittering blade straight for 
her. 


And shot bolt-upright in her bed, panting, sweating, clutching the sheets about her for protection. Her 
eyes flew open into the darkness of her own room. She could see shapes and shadows of her precious, 
familiar life, in the gray light coming through the window. The canopy of her bed, overhead, more 
protective than the tree she had just died under. The warmth of the bedclothes she gripped tightly to 
herself. The-


Twin red spots burned in the shadows by the doorway. 


He was here, in her room! He had escaped from her dream! He-


She fought down the terror that was bubbling up within herself, moving slightly to get a better view of the 
redness. Then she sighed with relief. It was the light from her digital alarm, hitting her mirror on the far 
wall. There really wasn't anyone in the room with her at all. She was alone, and her parents were across 
the hall from her, and she was safe. Utterly, utterly safe. It had just been a dream. 


Then the redness winked out. Terror started to build up again in her. She could feel something in the 
room, something malevolent, something watching her, savoring the smell of her fear. She couldn't turn her 
head to see. If she didn't look, maybe, maybe she'd be wrong, and it wasn't there. 


24 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 01 - The Awakening 
If the redness had been the alarm clock in the mirror, then why had it suddenly vanished? 

Refusing to surrender to the childish urge to dive under the bedcovers and cry, she fought the tense 
muscles in her neck, slowly managing to twist her head about to look at the clock. 

The front wasn't lit at all. Then, as she stared, the red numbers came back to life, blinking 12:00, over 
and over. 

She let her breath out in one long rush. It had been a momentary power failure, nothing more. The figures 
flashed on and off now, demanding to taken care of, and she reached out a hesitant hand for her watch. 
She half expected something to reach out of the gloom and grab her, but nothing did. She glanced at the 
watch-face, but could make nothing out. It was too dark. She switched on the bedside lamp, and quickly 
glanced all around her room. Everything was normal, just as it had been when she had turned off the light 
to go to sleep. 

3:32 in the morning! She brushed her hair back and reached over, setting the alarm again. Then she took 
a drink of the water on her night-table. One last look around, to be certain that all was fine, then she 
reached for the light. And hesitated. Maybe she'd be better off leaving it on for the last couple of hours of 
the night? Then she took a grip on her fears, and refused to revert to her childhood dread of the 
darkness. There was nothing there to harm her, nothing at all. It had just been a bad dream that she'd 
been having. For the fourth time. 
Fighting back her worries, she hastily switched off the light, and buried herself under the bedcovers again. 
Their warmth about her was comforting. But her nightdress stuck to her where she had been sweating, 
and she wriggled uncomfortably. She was exhausted, as if she'd really been running those terror-filled 
miles in the eerie forest. And her feet hurt. She rubbed at her left sole, trying to ease the cramping 
sensations. It didn't help much. And it felt rough, and sore. Almost as if she had been racing through 
woods in her bare feet. With a sigh of relief, she was just glad that there wasn't any blood or scratches on 

her body. Had there been, she just might have given in to the panic that lurked slightly over the threshold 
of her consciousness. She was afraid to return to sleep, in case the dream came back. Maybe she'd just 
stay awake until the morning... Slowly, without being aware of it, Sharon drifted into a dreamless 
slumber for the remainder of the night.

To my dear friend and sister, Judy 


One 

"Damon!" 

Icy wind whipped Elena's hair around her face, tearing at her light sweater. Oak 
leaves swirled among the rows of granite headstones, and the trees lashed their 
branches together in frenzy. Elena's hands were cold, her lips and cheeks were 
numb, but she stood facing the screaming wind directly, shouting into it. 

"Damon!" 

This weather was a show of his Power, meant to frighten her away. It wouldn't 
work. The thought of that same Power being turned against Stefan woke a hot fury 
inside her that burned against the wind. If Damon had done anything to Stefan, if 
Damon had hurt him... 

"Damn you, answer me!" she shouted at the oak trees that bordered the 
graveyard. 

A dead oak leaf like a withered brown hand skittered up to her foot, but there was 
no answer. Above, the sky was gray as glass, gray as the tombstones that 
surrounded her. Elena felt rage and frustration sting her throat and she sagged. She'd 
been wrong. Damon wasn't here after all; she was alone with the screaming wind. 

She turned-and gasped. 

He was just behind her, so close that her clothes brushed his as she turned. At 
that distance, she should have sensed another human being standing there, should 
have felt his body warmth or heard him. But Damon, of course, wasn't human. 

Page 2 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
She reeled back a couple of steps before she could stop herself. Every instinct 
that had lain quiet while she shouted into the violence of the wind was now begging 
her to run. 

She clenched her fists. "Where's Stefan?" 

A line appeared between Damon's dark eyebrows. "Stefan who?" 

Elena stepped forward and slapped him. 

She had no thought of doing it before she did it, and afterward she could scarcely 
believe what she had done. But it was a good hard slap, with the full force of her 
body behind it, and it snapped Damon's head to one side. Her hand stung. She 
stood, trying to calm her breath, and watched him. 

He was dressed as she had first seen him, in black. Soft black boots, black jeans, 
black sweater, and leather jacket. And he looked like Stefan. She didn't know how 
she could have missed that before. He had the same dark hair, the same pale skin, 
the same disturbing good looks. But his hair was straight, not wavy, and his eyes 
were black as midnight, and his mouth was cruel. 


He turned his head slowly back to look at her, and she saw blood rising in the 
cheek she'd slapped. 

He turned his head slowly back to look at her, and she saw blood rising in the 
cheek she'd slapped. 

"Has he?" 

"You know he has!" 

Damon smiled and then turned it off instantly. 

"I'm warning you; if you've hurt him-" 

"Then, what?" he said. "What will you do, Elena? What can you do, against me?" 

Elena fell silent. For the first time, she realized that the wind had died away. The 
day had gone deadly quiet around them, as if they stood motionless at the center of 
some great circle of power. It seemed as if everything, the leaden sky, the oaks and 
purple beeches, the ground itself, was connected to him, as if he drew Power from 
all of it. He stood with his head tilted back slightly, his eyes fathomless and full of 
strange lights. 

"I don't know," she whispered, "but I'll find something. Believe me." 

He laughed suddenly, and Elena's heart jerked and began pounding hard. God, he 
was beautiful. Handsome was too weak and colorless a word. As usual, the laughter 
lasted only a moment, but even when his lips had sobered it left traces in his eyes. 

Page 3 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
"I do believe you," he said, relaxing, looking around the graveyard. Then he 
turned back and held out a hand to her. "You're too good for my brother," he said 
casually. 

Elena thought of slapping the hand away, but she didn't want to touch him again. 
"Tell me where he is." 

"Later, possibly-for a price." He withdrew his hand, just as Elena realized that 
on it he wore a ring like Stefan's: silver and lapis lazuli. Remember that, she thought 
fiercely. It's important. 

"My brother," he went on, "is a fool. He thinks that because you look like 
Katherine you're weak and easily led like her. But he's wrong. I could feel your anger 
from the other side of town. I can feel it now, a white light like the desert sun. You 
have strength, Elena, even as you are. But you could be so much stronger..." 

She stared at him, not understanding, not liking the change of subject. "I don't 
know what you're talking about. And what has it got to do with Stefan?" 

"I'm talking about Power, Elena." Suddenly, he stepped close to her, his eyes 
fixed on hers, his voice soft and urgent. "You've tried everything else, and nothing 
has satisfied you. You're the girl who has everything, but there's always been 
something just out of your reach, something you need desperately and can't have. 
That's what I'm offering you. Power. Eternal life. And feelings you've never felt 
before." 


She did understand then, and bile rose in her throat. She choked on horror and 
repudiation. "No." 

She did understand then, and bile rose in her throat. She choked on horror and 
repudiation. "No." 

"No," she said, wrenching her eyes away from his. She wouldn't look at him, 
wouldn't let him do this to her. She wouldn't let him make her forget... make her 
forget... 

"It's the ultimate secret, Elena," he said. His voice was as caressing as the 
fingertips that touched her throat. "You'll be happy as never before." 

There was something terribly important she must remember. He was using Power 
to make her forget it, but she wouldn't let him make her forget... 

"And we'll be together, you and I." The cool fingertips stroked the side of her 
neck, slipping under the collar of her sweater. "Just the two of us, forever." 

There was a sudden twinge of pain as his fingers brushed two tiny wounds in the 
flesh of her neck, and her mind cleared. 

Make her forget... Stefan. 

Page 4 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
That was what he wanted to drive out of her mind. The memory of Stefan, of his 
green eyes and his smile that always had sadness lurking behind it. But nothing could 
force Stefan out of her thoughts now, not after what they had shared. She pulled 
away from Damon, knocking those cool fingertips aside. She looked straight at him. 


"I've already found what I want," she said brutally. "And who I want to be with 
forever." 


Blackness welled up in his eyes, a cold rage that swept through the air between 
them. Looking into those eyes, Elena thought of a cobra about to strike. 


"Don't you be as stupid as my brother is," he said. "Or I might have to treat you 
the same way." 


She was frightened now. She couldn't help it, not with cold pouring into her, 
chilling her bones. The wind was picking up again, the branches tossing. "Tell me 
where he is, Damon." 


"At this moment? I don't know. Can't you stop thinking about him for an instant?" 


"No!" She shuddered, hair lashing about her face again. 


"And that's your final answer, today? Be very sure you want to play this game 
with me, Elena. The consequences are nothing to laugh about." 


"I am sure." She had to stop him before he got to her again. "And you can't 
intimidate me, Damon, or haven't you noticed? The moment Stefan told me what you 


. 
were, what you'd done, you lost any power you might have had over me. I hate you. 
You disgust me. And there's nothing you can do to me, not any more." 


were, what you'd done, you lost any power you might have had over me. I hate you. 
You disgust me. And there's nothing you can do to me, not any more." 


He stepped back, and the wind cut through Elena like a knife. Her vision seemed 
to be blurring; it was as if flecks of brightness filled the air in front of her eyes. 


"Winter is coming, Elena," he said, and his voice was clear and chilling even over 
the howl of the wind. "An unforgiving season. Before it comes, you'll have learned 
what I can and can't do. Before winter is here, you'll have joined me. You'll be 
mine." 


The swirling whiteness was blinding her, and she could no longer see the dark 
bulk of his figure. Now even his voice was fading. She hugged herself with her arms, 
head bent down, her whole body shaking. She whispered, "Stefan-" 


"Oh, and one more thing," Damon's voice came back. "You asked earlier about 
my brother. Don't bother looking for him, Elena. I killed him last night."

Her head jerked up, but there was nothing to see, only the dizzying whiteness, 
which burned her nose and cheeks and clogged her eyelashes. It was only then, as 
the fine grains settled on her skin, that she realized what they were: snowflakes. 

It was snowing on the first of November. Overhead, the sun was gone. 


Two 

An unnatural twilight hung over the abandoned graveyard. Snow blurred Elena's 
eyes, and the wind numbed her body as if she'd stepped into a current of ice water. 
Nevertheless, stubbornly, she did not turn around toward the modern cemetery and 
the road beyond it. As best she could judge, Wickery Bridge was straight in front of 
her. She headed for that. 

The police had found Stefan's abandoned car by Old Creek Road. That meant 
he'd left it somewhere between Drowning Creek and the woods. Elena stumbled on 
the overgrown path through the graveyard, but she kept moving, head down, arms 
hugging her light sweater to her. She had known this graveyard all her life, and she 
could find her way through it blind. 

By the time she crossed the bridge, her shivering had become painful. It wasn't 
snowing as hard now, but the wind was even worse. It cut through her clothes as if 
they were made of tissue paper, and took her breath away. 

Stefan, she thought, and turned onto Old Creek Road, trudging northward. She 
didn't believe what Damon had said. If Stefan were dead she would know. He was 
alive, somewhere, and she had to find him. He could be anywhere out in this swirling 
whiteness; he could be hurt, freezing. Dimly, Elena sensed that she was no longer 
rational. All her thoughts had narrowed down to one single idea. Stefan. Find Stefan. 

It was getting harder to keep to the road. On her right were oak trees, on her left, 
the swift waters of Drowning Creek. She staggered and slowed. The wind didn't 
seem quite so bad any more, but she did feel very tired. She needed to sit down and 
rest, just for a minute. 

As she sank down beside the road, she suddenly realized how silly she had been 
to go out searching for Stefan. Stefan would come to her. All she needed to do was 
sit here and wait. He was probably coming right now. 

Elena shut her eyes and leaned her head against her drawn-up knees. She felt 
much warmer now. Her mind drifted and she saw Stefan, saw him smile at her. His 
arms around her were strong and secure, and she relaxed against him, glad to let go 
of fear and tension. She was home. She-was where she belonged. Stefan would 
never let anything hurt her. 

But then, instead of holding her, Stefan was shaking her. He was ruining the 
beautiful tranquility of her rest. She saw his face, pale and urgent, his green eyes dark 
with pain. She tried to tell him to be still, but he wouldn't listen. Elena, get up, he 
said, and she felt the compelling force of those green eyes willing her to do it. Elena,

get up now-


"Elena, get up!" The voice was high and thin and frightened. "Come on, Elena! 
Get up! We can't carry you!" 


Blinking, Elena brought a face into focus. It was small and heart-shaped, with fair, 
almost translucent skin, framed by masses of soft red curls. Wide brown eyes, with

snowflakes caught in the lashes, stared worriedly into hers. 


snowflakes caught in the lashes, stared worriedly into hers. 


"Helping me look for you," said a second, lower voice on Elena's other side. She 
turned slightly to see elegantly arched eyebrows and an olive complexion. Meredith's 
dark eyes, usually so ironic, were worried now, too. "Stand up, Elena, unless you 
want to become an ice princess for real." 


There was snow all over her, like a white fur coat. Stiffly, Elena stood, leaning 
heavily on the two other girls. They walked her back to Meredith's car. 


It should have been warmer inside the car, but Elena's nerve endings were coming 
back to life, making her shake, telling her how cold she really was. Winter is an 
unforgiving season, she thought as Meredith drove. 


"What's going on, Elena?" said Bonnie from the back seat. "What did you think 
you were doing, running away from school like that? And how could you come out 
here?" 


Elena hesitated, then shook her head. She wanted nothing more than to tell Bonnie 
and Meredith everything. To tell them the whole terrifying story about Stefan and 
Damon and what had really happened last night to Mr. Tanner-and about after. But 
she couldn't. 


Even if they would believe her, it wasn't her secret to tell. 


"Everyone's out looking for you," Meredith said. "The whole school's upset, and 
your aunt was nearly frantic." 


"Sorry," said Elena dully, trying to stop her violent shivering. They turned onto 
Maple Street and pulled up to her house. 


Aunt Judith was waiting inside with heated blankets. "I knew if they found you, 
you'd be half-frozen," she said in a determinedly cheerful voice as she reached for 
Elena. "Snow on the day after Halloween! I can hardly believe it. Where did you girls 
find her?" 


"On Old Creek Road, past the bridge," said Meredith. 


Aunt Judith's thin face lost color. "Near the graveyard? Where the attacks were? 
Elena, how could you?..." Her voice trailed off as she looked at Elena. "We won't 


Page 7 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
say anything more about it right now," she said, trying to regain her cheerful manner. 
"Let's get you out of those wet clothes." 

"I have to go back once I'm dry," said Elena. Her brain was working again, and 
one thing was clear: she hadn't really seen Stefan out there; it had been a dream. 
Stefan was still missing. 

"You have to do nothing of the kind," said Robert, Aunt Judith's fianc... Elena 
had scarcely noticed him standing off to one side until then. But his tone brooked no 
argument. "The police are looking for Stefan; you leave them to their job," he said. 

"The police think he killed Mr. Tanner. But he didn't. You know that, don't you?" 
As Aunt Judith pulled her sodden outer sweater off, Elena looked from one face to 


another for help, but they were all the same. "You know he didn't do it," she 
repeated, almost desperately. 

another for help, but they were all the same. "You know he didn't do it," she 
repeated, almost desperately. 

"He didn't run away. He didn't! He didn't-" 

"Elena, hush," said Aunt Judith. "Don't get yourself worked up. I think you must 
be getting sick. It was so cold out there, and you got only a few hours of sleep last 
night..." She laid a hand on Elena's cheek. 

Suddenly it was all too much for Elena. Nobody believed her, not even her friends 
and family. At that moment, she felt surrounded by enemies. 

"I'm not sick," she cried, pulling away. 

"And I'm not crazy, either-whatever you think. Stefan didn't run away and he 
didn't kill Mr. Tanner, and I don't care if none of you believes me..." She stopped, 
choking. Aunt Judith was fussing around her, hurrying her upstairs, and she let 
herself be hurried. But she wouldn't go to bed when Aunt Judith suggested she must 
be tired. Instead, once she had warmed up, she sat on the living room couch by the 
fireplace, with blankets heaped around her. The phone rang all afternoon, and she 
heard Aunt Judith talking to friends, neighbors, the school. She assured all of them 
that Elena was fine. The... the tragedy last night had unsettled her a bit, that was all, 
and she seemed a little feverish. But she'd be good as new after a rest. 

Meredith and Bonnie sat beside her. "Do you want to talk?" Meredith said in a 
low voice. Elena shook her head, staring into the fire. They were all against her. And 
Aunt Judith was wrong; she wasn't fine. She wouldn't be fine until Stefan was found. 

Matt stopped by, snow dusting his blond hair and his dark blue parka. As he 
entered the room, Elena looked up at him hopefully. Yesterday Matt had helped save 
Stefan, when the rest of the school had wanted to lynch him. But today he returned 
her hopeful look with one of sober regret, and the concern in his blue eyes was only 
for her. 

Page 8 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
The disappointment was unbearable. "What are you doing here?" Elena 
demanded. "Keeping your promise to 'take care of me'?" 

There was a flicker of hurt in his eyes. But Matt's voice was level. "That's part of 
it, maybe. But I'd try to take care of you anyway, no matter what I promised. I've 
been worried about you. Listen, Elena-" 

She was in no mood to listen to anyone. "Well, I'm just fine, thank you. Ask 
anybody here. So you can stop worrying. Besides, I don't see why you should keep 
a promise to a murderer." 

Startled, Matt looked at Meredith and Bonnie. Then he shook his head helplessly. 
"You're not being fair." 

Elena was in no mood to be fair either. "I told you, you can stop worrying about 
me, and about my business. I'm fine, thanks." 


The implication was obvious. Matt turned to the door just as Aunt Judith 
appeared with sandwiches. 

The implication was obvious. Matt turned to the door just as Aunt Judith 
appeared with sandwiches. 

Meredith and Bonnie and Aunt Judith and 

Robert tried to make conversation while they ate an early supper by the fire. Elena 
couldn't eat and wouldn't talk. The only one who wasn't miserable was Elena's little 
sister, Margaret. With four-year-old optimism, she cuddled up to Elena and offered 
her some of her Halloween candy. 

Elena hugged her sister hard, her face pressed into Margaret's white-blond hair for 
a moment. If Stefan could have called her or gotten a message to her, he would have 
done it by now. Nothing in the world would have stopped him, unless he were badly 
hurt, or trapped somewhere, or... 

She wouldn't let herself think about that last "or." Stefan was alive; he had to be 
alive. Damon was a liar. 

But Stefan was in trouble, and she had to find him somehow. She worried about it 
all through the evening, desperately trying to come up with a plan. One thing was 
clear; she was on her own. She couldn't trust anyone. 

It grew dark. Elena shifted on the couch and forced a yawn. 

"I'm tired," she said quietly. "Maybe I am sick after all. I think I'll go to bed." 

Meredith was looking at her keenly. "I was just thinking, Miss Gilbert," she said, 
turning to Aunt Judith, "that maybe Bonnie and I should stay the night. To keep 
Elena company." 

Page 9 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
"What a good idea," said Aunt Judith, pleased. "As long as your parents don't 
mind, I'd be glad to have you." 

"It's a long drive back to Herron. I think I'll stay, too," Robert said. "I can just 
stretch out on the couch here." Aunt Judith protested that there were plenty of guest 
bedrooms upstairs, but Robert was adamant. The couch would do just fine for him, 
he said. 

After looking once from the couch to the hall where the front door stood plainly 
in view, Elena sat stonily. They'd planned this between them, or at least they were all 
in on it now. They were making sure she didn't leave the house. 

When she emerged from the bathroom a little while later, wrapped in her red silk 
kimono, she found Meredith and Bonnie sitting on her bed. 

"Well, hello, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern," she said bitterly. 

Bonnie, who had been looking depressed, now looked alarmed. She glanced at 
Meredith doubtfully. 

"She knows who we are. She means she thinks we're spies for her aunt," 
Meredith interpreted. "Elena, you should realize that isn't so. Can't you trust us at 


all?" 

all?" 

"Yes, because we're your friends." Before Elena could move, Meredith jumped 
off the bed and shut the door. Then she turned to face Elena. "Now, for once in 
your life, listen to me, you little idiot. It's true we don't know what to think about 
Stefan. But, don't you see, that's your own fault. Ever since you and he got together, 
you've been shutting us out. Things have been happening that you haven't told us 
about. At least you haven't told us the whole story. But in spite of that, in spite of 
everything, we still trust you. We still care about you. We're still behind you, Elena, 
and we want to help. And if you can't see that, then you are an idiot." 

Slowly, Elena looked from Meredith's dark, intense face to Bonnie's pale one. 
Bonnie nodded. 

"It's true," she said, blinking hard as if to keep back tears. "Even if you don't like 
us, we still like you." 

Elena felt her own eyes fill and her stern expression crumple. Then Bonnie was 
off the bed, and they were all hugging, and Elena found she couldn't help the tears 
that slid down her face. 

"I'm sorry if I haven't been talking to you," she said. "I know you don't 
understand, and I can't even explain why I can't tell you everything. I just can't. But 
there's one thing I can tell you." She stepped back, wiping her cheeks, and looked at

L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
them earnestly. "No matter how bad the evidence against Stefan looks, he didn't kill 
Mr. Tanner. I know he didn't, because I know who did. And it's the same person 
who attacked Vickie, and the old man under the bridge. And-" She stopped and 
thought a moment. "-and, oh, Bonnie, I think he killed Yangtze, too." 


"Yangtze?" Bonnie's eyes widened. "But why would he want to kill a dog?" 


"I don't know, but he was there that night, in your house. And he was... angry. 
I'm sorry, Bonnie." 


Bonnie shook her head dazedly. Meredith said, "Why don't you tell the police?" 


Elena's laugh was slightly hysterical. "I can't. It's not something they can deal 
with. And that's another thing I can't explain. You said you still trusted me; well, 
you'll just have to trust me about that." 


Bonnie and Meredith looked at each other, then at the bedspread, where Elena's 
nervous fingers were picking a thread out of the embroidery. Finally Meredith said, 
"All right. What can we do to help?" 


"I don't know. Nothing, unless..." Elena stopped and looked at Bonnie. "Unless," 
she said, in a changed voice, "you can help me find Stefan." 


Bonnie's brown eyes were genuinely bewildered. "Me? But what can I do?" Then, 
at Meredith's indrawn breath, she said, "Oh. Oh." 


"You knew where I was that day I went to the cemetery," said Elena. "And you 
even predicted Stefan's coming to school." 


. 
"I thought you didn't believe in all that psychic stuff," said Bonnie weakly. 


"I thought you didn't believe in all that psychic stuff," said Bonnie weakly. 


Bonnie was hunching up, as if trying to make her already tiny form as small as 
possible. "Elena, you don't understand," she said wretchedly. "I'm not trained; it's 
not something I can control. And-and it's not a game, not any more. The more you 
use those powers, the more they use you. Eventually they can end up using you all 
the time, whether you want it or not. It's dangerous." 


Elena got up and walked to the cherry wood dresser, looking down at it without 
seeing it. At last she turned. 


"You're right; it's not a game. And I believe you about how dangerous it can be. 
But it's not a game for Stefan, either. Bonnie, I think he's out there, somewhere, 
terribly hurt. And there's nobody to help him; nobody's even looking for him, except 
his enemies. He may be dying right now. He-he may even be..." Her throat closed. 
She bowed her head over the dresser and made herself take a deep breath, trying to 
steady herself. When she looked up, she saw Meredith was looking at Bonnie. 


Bonnie straightened her shoulders, sitting up as tall as she could. Her chin lifted 


1 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
and her mouth set. And in her normally soft brown eyes, a grim light shone as they 
met Elena's. 


"We need a candle," was all she said. 


The match rasped and threw sparks in the darkness, and then the candle flame 
burned strong and bright. It lent a golden glow to Bonnie's pale face as she bent over 
it. 


"I'm going to need both of you to help me focus," she said. "Look into the flame, 
and think about Stefan. Picture him in your mind. No matter what happens, keep on 
looking at the flame. And whatever you do, don't say anything." 


Elena nodded, and then the only sound in the room was soft breathing. The flame 
flickered and danced, throwing patterns of light over the three girls sitting 
cross-legged around it. Bonnie, eyes closed, was breathing deeply and slowly, like 
someone drifting into sleep. 


Stefan, thought Elena, gazing into the flame, trying to pour all her will into the 
thought. She created him in her mind, using all her senses, conjuring him to her. The 
roughness of his woolen sweater under her cheek, the smell of his leather jacket, the 
strength of his arms around her. Oh, Stefan... 


Bonnie's lashes fluttered and her breathing quickened, like a sleeper having a bad 
dream. Elena resolutely kept her eyes on the flame, but when Bonnie broke the 
silence a chill went up her spine. 


At first it was just a moan, the sound of someone in pain. Then, as Bonnie tossed 
her head, breath coming in short bursts, it became words. 


"Alone..." she said, and stopped. Elena's nails bit into her hand. "Alone... in the

dark," said Bonnie. Her voice was distant and tortured. 


dark," said Bonnie. Her voice was distant and tortured. 


"It's dark and cold. And I'm alone. There's something behind me... jagged and 
hard. Rocks. They used to hurt-but not now. I'm numb now, from the cold. So 
cold..." Bonnie twisted, as if trying to get away from something, and then she 
laughed, a dreadful laugh almost like a sob. "That's... funny. I never thought I'd 
want to see the sun so much. But it's always dark here. And cold. Water up to my 
neck, like ice. That's funny, too. Water everywhere-and me dying of thirst. So 
thirsty... hurts..." 


Elena felt something tighten around her heart. Bonnie was inside Stefan's 
thoughts, and who knew what she might discover there? Stefan, tell us where you 
are, she thought desperately. Look around; tell me what you see. 


"Thirsty. I need... life?" Bonnie's voice was doubtful, as if not sure how to 
translate some concept. "I'm weak. He said I'll always be the weak one. He's strong 


2 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
... a killer. But that's what I am, too. I killed Katherine; maybe I deserve to die. Why 
not just let go?..." 

"No!" said Elena before she could stop herself. In that instant, she forgot 
everything but Stefan's pain. "Stefan-" 

"Elena!" Meredith cried sharply at the same time. But Bonnie's head fell forward, 
the flow of words cut off. Horrified, Elena realized what she had done. 

"Bonnie, are you all right? Can you find him again? I didn't mean to..." 

Bonnie's head lifted. Her eyes were open now, but they looked at neither the 
candle nor Elena. They stared straight ahead, expressionless. When she spoke, her 
voice was distorted, and Elena's heart stopped. It wasn't Bonnie's voice, but it was a 
voice Elena recognized. She'd heard it coming from Bonnie's lips once before, in the 
graveyard. 

"Elena," the voice said, "don't go to the bridge. It's Death, Elena. Your death is 
waiting there." Then Bonnie slumped forward. 

Elena grabbed her shoulders and shook. "Bonnie!" she almost screamed. 
"Bonnie!" 

"What... oh, don't. Let go." Bonnie's voice was weak and shaken, but it was her 
own. Still bent over, she put a hand to her forehead. 

"Bonnie, are you all right?" 

"I think so... yes. But it was so strange." Her tone sharpened and she looked up, 
blinking. "What was that, Elena, about being a killer?" 

"You remember that?" 

"I remember everything. I can't describe it; it was awful. But what did that mean?" 

"Nothing," said Elena. "He's hallucinating, that's all." 

Meredith broke in. "He? Then you really think she tuned in to Stefan?" 


Elena nodded, her eyes sore and burning as she looked away. "Yes. I think that 
was Stefan. It had to be. And I think she even told us where he is. Under Wickery 
Bridge, in the water." 


Three 

Bonnie stared. "I don't remember anything about the bridge. It didn't feel like a 
bridge."

L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
"But you said it yourself, at the end. I thought you remembered..." Elena's voice 


died away. "You don't remember that part," she said flatly. It was not a question. 
"I remember being alone, somewhere cold and dark, and feeling weak... and 
thirsty. Or was it hungry? I don't know, but I needed... something. And I almost 
wanted to die. And then you woke me up." 


Elena and Meredith exchanged a glance. "And after that," Elena said to Bonnie, 
"you said one more thing, in a strange voice. You said not to go near the bridge." 
"She told you not to go near the bridge." 


Meredith corrected. "You in particular, Elena. She said Death was waiting." 
"I don't care what's waiting," said Elena. "If that's where Stefan is, that's where 
I'm going." 


"Then that's where we're all going," said Meredith. 


Elena hesitated. "I can't ask you to do that," she said slowly. "There might be 
danger-of a kind you don't know about. It might be best for me to go alone." 
"Are you kidding?" Bonnie said, sticking her chin out. "We love danger. I want to 


be young and beautiful in my grave, remember?" 
"Don't," said Elena quickly. "You were the one who said it wasn't a game." 
"And not for Stefan, either," Meredith reminded them. "We're not doing him 


much good standing around here." 


Elena was already shrugging out of her kimono, moving toward the closet. "We'd 
better all bundle up. Borrow anything you want to keep warm," she said. 
When they were more or less dressed for the weather, Elena turned to the door. 


Then she stopped. 


"Robert," she said. "There's no way we can get past him to the front door, even if 
he's asleep." 
Simultaneously, the three of them turned to look at the window. 
"Oh, wonderful," said Bonnie. 
As they climbed out into the quince tree, Elena realized that it had stopped 


snowing. But the bite of the air on her cheek made her remember Damon's words. 


Winter is an unforgiving season, she thought, and shivered. 
All the lights in the house were out, including those in the living room. Robert 
must have gone to sleep already. Even so, Elena held her breath as they crept past 
the darkened windows. Meredith's car was a little way down the street. At the last

minute, Elena decided to get some rope, and she soundlessly opened the back door 
to the garage. There was a swift current in Drowning Creek, and wading would be 
dangerous.

to the garage. There was a swift current in Drowning Creek, and wading would be 
dangerous. 

"Bonnie, do oak trees have any special significance? Did your grandmother ever 
say anything about them?" 

"Well, they were sacred to the Druids. All trees were, but oak trees were the most 
sacred. They thought the spirit of the trees brought them power." 

Elena digested that in silence. When they reached the bridge and got out of the 
car, she gave the oak trees on the right side of the road an uneasy glance. But the 
night was clear and strangely calm, and no breeze stirred the dry brown leaves left on 
the branches. 

"Keep your eyes out for a crow," she said to Bonnie and Meredith. 

"A crow?" Meredith said sharply. "Like the crow outside Bonnie's house the night 
Yangtze died?" 

"The night Yangtze was killed. Yes." Elena approached the dark waters of 
Drowning Creek with a rapidly beating heart. Despite its name, it was not a creek, 
but a swiftly flowing river with banks of red native clay. Above it stood Wickery 
Bridge, a wooden structure built nearly a century ago. Once, it had been strong 
enough to support wagons; now it was just a footbridge that nobody used because it 
was so out of the way. It was a barren, lonely, unfriendly place, Elena thought. Here 
and there patches of snow lay on the ground. 

Despite her brave words earlier, Bonnie was hanging back. "Remember the last 
time we went over this bridge?" she said. 

Too well, Elena thought. The last time they had crossed it, they were being 
chased by... something... from the graveyard. Or someone, she thought. 

"We're not going over it yet," she said. "First we've got to look under it on this 
side." 

"Where the old man was found with his throat torn open," Meredith muttered, but 
she followed. 

The car headlights illuminated only a small portion of the bank under the bridge. 
As Elena stepped out of the narrow wedge of light, she felt a sick thrill of 
foreboding. Death was waiting, the voice had said. Was Death down here? 

Her feet slipped on the damp, scummy stones. All she could hear was the rushing 
of the water, and its hollow echo from the bridge above her head. And, though she 

5 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
strained her eyes, all she could see in the darkness was the raw riverbank and the 
wooden trestles of the bridge. 

"Stefan?" she whispered, and she was almost glad that the noise of the water 


drowned her out. She felt like a person calling "who's there?" to an empty house, yet 
afraid of what might answer. 

drowned her out. She felt like a person calling "who's there?" to an empty house, yet 
afraid of what might answer. 

"What do you mean?" 

Bonnie was looking around, shaking her head slightly, her body taut with 
concentration. "It just feels wrong. I don't-well, for one thing I didn't hear the river 
before. I couldn't hear anything at all, just dead silence." 

Elena's heart dropped with dismay. Part of her knew that Bonnie was right, that 
Stefan wasn't in this wild and lonely place. But part of her was too scared to listen. 

"We've got to make sure," she said through the constriction in her chest, and she 
moved farther into the darkness, feeling her way along because she couldn't see. But 
at last she had to admit that there was no sign that any person had recently been 
here. No sign of a dark head in the water, either. She wiped cold muddy hands on 
her jeans. 

"We can check the other side of the bridge," said Meredith, and Elena nodded 
mechanically. But she didn't need to see Bonnie's expression to know what they'd 
find. This was the wrong place. 

"Let's just get out of here," she said, climbing through vegetation toward the 
wedge of light beyond the bridge. Just as she reached it, Elena froze. 

Bonnie gasped. "Oh, God-" 

"Get back," hissed Meredith. "Up against the bank." 

Clearly silhouetted against the car headlights above was a black figure. Elena, 
staring with a wildly beating heart, could tell nothing about it except that it was male. 
The face was in darkness, but she had a terrible feeling. 

It was moving toward them. 

Ducking out of sight, Elena cowered back against the muddy riverbank under the 
bridge, pressing herself as flat as possible. She could feel Bonnie shaking behind 
her, and Meredith's fingers sank into her arm. 

They could see nothing from here, but suddenly there was a heavy footfall on the 
bridge. Scarcely daring to breathe, they clung to one another, faces turned up. The 
heavy footsteps rang across the wooden planks, moving away from them.

L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
Please let him keep going, thought Elena. Oh, please... 


She sank her teeth into her lip, and then Bonnie whimpered softly, her icy hand 
clutching Elena's. The footsteps were coming back. 


I should go out there, Elena thought. It's me he wants, not them. He said as much. 
I should go out there and face him, and maybe he'll let Bonnie and Meredith leave. 
But the fiery rage that had sustained her that morning was in ashes now. With all her 
strength of will, she could not make her hand let go of Bonnie's, could not tear 
herself away. 


. 
The footsteps sounded right above them. Then there was silence, followed by a 
slithering sound on the bank. 


The footsteps sounded right above them. Then there was silence, followed by a 
slithering sound on the bank. 


"What are you doing down there?" 


Elena's mind refused to process this information at first. It was still panicking, and 
she almost screamed as Matt took another step down the bank, peering under the 
bridge. 


"Elena? What are you doing?" he said again. 


Bonnie's head flew up. Meredith's breath exploded in relief. Elena herself felt as if 
her knees might give way. 


"Matt," she said. It was all she could manage. 


Bonnie was more vocal. "What do you think you're doing?" she said in rising 
tones. "Trying to give us a heart attack? What are you out here for at this time of 
night?" 


Matt thrust a hand into his pocket, rattling change. As they emerged from under 
the bridge, he stared out over the river. "I followed you." 


"You what?" said Elena. 


Reluctantly, he swung to face her. "I followed you," he repeated, shoulders tense. 
"I figured you'd find a way to get around your aunt and go out again. So I sat in my 
car across the street and watched your house. Sure enough, you three came climbing 
out the window. So I followed you here." 


Elena didn't know what to say. She was angry, and of course, he had probably 
done it only to keep his promise to Stefan. But the thought of Matt sitting out there 
in his battered old Ford, probably freezing to death and without any supper... it gave 
her a strange pang she didn't want to dwell on.

L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
He was looking out at the river again. She stepped closer to him and spoke 
quietly. 


"I'm sorry, Matt," she said. "About the way I acted back at the house, and-and 
about-" She fumbled for a minute and then gave up. About everything, she thought 
hopelessly. 


"Well, I'm sorry for scaring you just now." He turned back briskly to face her, as 
if that settled the matter. "Now could you please tell me what you think you're 
doing?" 


"Bonnie thought Stefan might be here." 


"Bonnie did not," said Bonnie. "Bonnie said right away that it was the wrong 
place. We're looking for somewhere quiet, no noises, and closed in. I felt... 
surrounded," she explained to Matt. 


. 
Matt looked back at her warily, as if she might bite. "Sure you did," he said. 
"There were rocks around me, but not like these river rocks." 
"Uh, no, of course they weren't." He looked sideways at Meredith, who took pity 


on him. 


"Bonnie had a vision," she said. 


Matt backed up a little, and Elena could see his profile in the headlights. From his 
expression, she could tell he didn't know whether to walk away or to round them all 
up and cart them to the nearest insane asylum. 


"It's no joke," she said. "Bonnie's psychic, Matt. I know I've always said I didn't 
believe in that sort of thing, but I've been wrong. You don't know how wrong. 
Tonight, she-she tuned in to Stefan somehow and got a glimpse of where he is." 


Matt drew a long breath. "I see. Okay..." 


"Don't patronize me! I'm not stupid, Matt, and I'm telling you this is for real. She 
was there, with Stefan; she knew things only he would know. And she saw the place 
he's trapped in." 


"Trapped," said Bonnie. "That's it. It was definitely nothing open like a river. But 
there was water, water up to my neck. His neck. And rock walls around, covered 


with thick moss. The water was ice cold and still, and it smelled bad." 


"But what did you see?" Elena said. 


"Nothing. It was like being blind. Somehow I knew that if there was even the 


faintest ray of light I would be able to see, but I couldn't. It was black as a tomb." 


8 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
"As a tomb..." Thin chills went through Elena. She thought about the ruined 
church on the hill above the graveyard. There was a tomb there, a tomb she thought 
had opened once. 
"But a tomb wouldn't be that wet," Meredith was saying. 


"No... but I don't get any sense of where it could be then," Bonnie said. "Stefan 
wasn't really in his right mind; he was so weak and hurt. And so thirsty-" 
Elena opened her mouth to stop Bonnie from going on, but just then Matt broke 


in. 
"I'll tell you what it sounds like to me," he said. 
The three girls looked at him, standing slightly apart from their group like an 
eavesdropper. They had almost forgotten about him. 
"Well?" said Elena. 
"Exactly," he said. "I mean, it sounds like a well." 
Elena blinked, excitement stirring in her. "Bonnie?" 
"It could be," said Bonnie slowly. "The size and the walls and everything would 
be right. But a well is open; I should have been able to see the stars." 
. 


"Not if it were covered," said Matt. "A lot of the old farmhouses around here 
have wells that are no longer in use, and some farmers cover them to make sure little 
kids don't fall in. My grandparents do." 


"Not if it were covered," said Matt. "A lot of the old farmhouses around here 
have wells that are no longer in use, and some farmers cover them to make sure little 
kids don't fall in. My grandparents do." 


"Yes, and it did have a sort of underground feeling." Bonnie was excited, too, but 
Meredith interrupted with a dry question. 


"How many wells do you think there are in Fell's Church, Matt?" 
"Dozens, probably," he said. "But covered? Not as many. And if you're 
suggesting somebody dumped Stefan in this one, then it can't be any place where 
people would see it. Probably somewhere abandoned..." 


"And his car was found on this road," said Elena. 


9 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
"The old Francher place," said Matt. 
They all looked at one another. The Francher farmhouse had been ruined and 
deserted for as long as anybody could remember. It stood in the middle of the 


woods, and the woods had taken it over nearly a century ago. 
"Let's go," added Matt simply. 
Elena put a hand on his arm. "You believe-?" 
He looked away a moment. "I don't know what to believe," he said at last. "But 


I'm coming." 
They split up and took both cars, Matt with Bonnie in the lead, and Meredith 


following with Elena. Matt took a disused little cart track into the woods until it 
petered out. 
"From here we walk," he said. 
Elena was glad she'd thought of bringing rope; they'd need it if Stefan were really 
in the Francher well. And if he wasn't... 
She wouldn't let herself think about that. 
It was hard going through the woods, especially in the dark. The underbrush was 


thick, and dead branches reached out to snatch at them. Moths fluttered around 


them, brushing Elena's cheek with unseen wings. 
Eventually they came to a clearing. The foundations of the old house could be 
seen, building stones tied to the ground now by weeds and brambles. For the most 
part, the chimney was still intact, with, hollow places where concrete had once held it 
together, like a crumbling monument. 

"The well would be somewhere out back," Matt said. 

It was Meredith who found it and called the others. They gathered around and 
looked at the flat, square block of stone almost level with the ground. 
Matt stooped and examined the dirt and weeds around it. "It's been moved 
. 


recently," he said. 
recently," he said. 
The stone slab was so heavy that Matt couldn't even shift it. Finally all four of 


them pushed, bracing themselves against the ground behind it, until, with a groan, the 
block moved a fraction of an inch. Once there was a tiny gap between stone and 
well, Matt used a dead branch to lever the opening wider. Then they all pushed 

Page 20 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
again. 

When there was an aperture large enough for her head and shoulders, Elena bent 
down, looking in. She was almost afraid to hope. 

"Stefan?" 

The seconds afterward, hovering over that black opening, looking down into 
darkness, hearing only the echoes of pebbles disturbed by her movement, were 
agonizing. Then, incredibly, there was another sound. 

"Who-? Elena?" 

"Oh, Stefan!" Relief made her wild. "Yes! I'm here, we're here, and we're going to 
get you out. Are you all right? Are you hurt?" The only thing that stopped her from 
tumbling in herself was Matt grabbing her from behind. "Stefan, hang on, we've got a 
rope. Tell me you're all right." 

There was a faint, almost unrecognizable sound, but Elena knew what it was. A 
laugh. Stefan's voice was thready but intelligible. "I've-been better," he said. "But 
I'm-alive. Who's with you?" 

"It's me. Matt," said Matt, releasing Elena. He bent over the hole himself. Elena, 
nearly delirious with elation, noted that he wore a slightly dazed look. "And Meredith 
and Bonnie, who's going to bend some spoons for us next. I'm going to throw you 
down a rope... that is, unless Bonnie can levitate you out." Still on his knees, he 
turned to look at Bonnie. 

She slapped the top of his head. "Don't joke about it! Get him up!" 

"Yes, ma'am," said Matt, a little giddily. "Here, Stefan. You're going to have to tie 
this around you." 

"Yes," said Stefan. He didn't argue about fingers numb with cold or whether or 
not they could haul his weight up. There was no other way. 

The next fifteen minutes were awful for Elena. It took all four of them to pull 
Stefan out, although Bonnie's main contribution was saying, "come on, come on," 
whenever they paused for breath. But at last Stefan's hands gripped the edge of the 
dark hole, and Matt reached forward to grab him under the shoulders. 

Then Elena was holding him, her arms locked around his chest. She could tell just 
how wrong things were by his unnatural stillness, by the limpness of his body. He'd 
used the last of his strength helping to pull himself out; his hands were cut and 


bloody. But what worried Elena most was the fact that those hands did not return 
her desperate embrace. 

bloody. But what worried Elena most was the fact that those hands did not return 
her desperate embrace. 

Page 21 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
She looked up at the others anxiously. 

Matt's brow was furrowed with concern. "We'd better get him to the clinic fast. 
He needs a doctor." 

"No!" The voice was weak and hoarse, and it came from the limp figure Elena 
cradled. 

She felt Stefan gather himself, felt him slowly raise his head. His green eyes fixed 
on hers, and she saw the urgency in them. 

"No... doctors." Those eyes burned into hers. "Promise... Elena." 

Elena's own eyes stung and her vision blurred. "I promise," she whispered. Then 
she felt whatever had been holding him up, the current of sheer willpower and 
determination, collapse. He slumped in her arms, unconscious.

"But he's got to have a doctor. He looks like he's dying!" said Bonnie. 

"He can't. I can't explain right now. Let's just get him home, all right? He's wet 
and freezing out here. Then we can discuss it." 

The job of getting Stefan through the woods was enough to occupy everyone's 
mind for a while. He remained unconscious, and when they finally laid him out in the 
back seat of Matt's car they were all bruised and exhausted, in addition to being wet 
from the contact with his soaking clothes. Elena held his head in her lap as they 
drove to the boarding house. Meredith and Bonnie followed. 

"I see lights on," Matt said, pulling in front of the large rust-red building. "She 
must be awake. But the door's probably locked." 

Elena gently eased Stefan's head down and slipped out of the car, and saw one of 
the windows in the house brighten as a curtain was pushed aside. Then she saw a 
head and shoulders appear at the window, looking down. 

"Mrs. Flowers!" she called, waving. "It's Elena Gilbert, Mrs. Flowers. We've 
found Stefan, and we need to get in!" 

The figure at the window did not move or otherwise acknowledge her words. Yet 
from its posture, Elena could tell it was still looking down on them. 

"Mrs. Flowers, we have Stefan," she called again, gesturing to the lighted interior 
of the car. "Please!" 

"Elena! It's unlocked already!" Bonnie's voice floated to her from the front porch, 
distracting Elena from the figure at the window. When she looked back up, she saw 

Page 22 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
the curtains falling into place, and then the light in that upstairs room snapped off. 


It was strange, but she had no time to puzzle over it. She and Meredith helped 
Matt lift Stefan and carry him up the front steps. 


Inside, the house was dark and still. Elena directed the others up the staircase that 
stood opposite the door, and onto the second-floor landing. From there they went 
into a bedroom, and Elena had Bonnie open the door of what looked like a closet. It 
revealed another stairway, very dim and narrow. 


"Who would leave their-front door unlocked-after all that's happened 
recently?" Matt grunted as they hauled their lifeless burden. "She must be crazy." 


"She is crazy," Bonnie said from above, pushing the door at the top of the 
staircase open. "Last time we were here she talked about the weirdest-" Her voice 
broke off in a gasp. 


"What is it?" said Elena. But as they reached the threshold of Stefan's room, she 
saw for herself. 


She'd forgotten the condition the room had been in the last time she'd seen it. 
Trunks filled with clothing were upended or lying on their sides, as if they'd been

thrown by some giant hand from wall to wall. Their contents were strewn about the 
floor, along with articles from the dresser and tables. Furniture was overturned, and 
a window was broken, allowing a cold wind to blow in. There was only one lamp 
on, in a corner, and grotesque shadows loomed against the ceiling. "What happened 
?" said Matt.

a window was broken, allowing a cold wind to blow in. There was only one lamp 
on, in a corner, and grotesque shadows loomed against the ceiling. "What happened

"I'll find another lamp," said Meredith, but Elena spoke quickly. 


"No, we can see all right. Why don't you try to get a fire going?" 


Spilling from one of the gaping trunks was a terry cloth robe of some dark color. 
Elena took it, and she and Matt began to strip off Stefan's wet and clinging clothes. 
She worked on getting his sweater off, but one glimpse of his neck was enough to 
freeze her in place. 


"Matt, could you-could you hand me that towel?" 


As soon as he turned, she tugged the sweater over Stefan's head and quickly 
wrapped the robe around him. When Matt turned back and handed her the towel, 
she wound it around Stefan's throat like a scarf. Her pulse was racing, her mind 
working furiously. 


Page 23 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
No wonder he was so weak, so lifeless. Oh, God. She had to examine him, to see 
how bad it was. But how could she, with Matt and the others here? 

"I'm going to get a doctor," Matt said in a tight voice, his eyes on Stefan's face. 
"He needs help, Elena." 

Elena panicked. "Matt, no... please. He -he's afraid of doctors. I don't know 
what would happen if you brought one here." Again, it was the truth, if not the whole 
truth. She had an idea of what might help Stefan, but she couldn't do it with the 
others there. She bent over Stefan, rubbing his hands between her own, trying to 
think. 

What could she do? Protect Stefan's secret at the cost of his life? Or betray him 
in order to save him? Would it save him to tell Matt and Bonnie and Meredith? She 
looked at her friends, trying to picture their response if they were to learn the truth 
about Stefan Salvatore. 

It was no good. She couldn't risk it. The shock and horror of the discovery had 
nearly sent Elena herself reeling into madness. If she, who loved Stefan, had been 
ready to run from him screaming, what would these three do? And then there was 
Mr. Tanner's murder. If they knew what Stefan was, would they ever be able to 
believe him innocent? Or, in their heart of hearts, would they always suspect him? 

Elena shut her eyes. It was just too dangerous. Meredith and Bonnie and Matt 
were her friends, but this was one thing she couldn't share with them. In all the 
world, there was no one she could trust with this secret. She would have to keep it 
alone. 


She straightened up and looked at Matt. "He's afraid of doctors, but a nurse 
might be all right." She turned to where Bonnie and Meredith were kneeling before 
the fireplace. "Bonnie, what about your sister?" 

She straightened up and looked at Matt. "He's afraid of doctors, but a nurse 
might be all right." She turned to where Bonnie and Meredith were kneeling before 
the fireplace. "Bonnie, what about your sister?" 

"Then that's it. Matt, you go with Bonnie and ask Mary to come here and look at 
Stefan. If she thinks he needs a doctor, I won't argue any more." 

Matt hesitated, then exhaled sharply. "All right. I still think you're wrong, but-
let's go, Bonnie. We're going to break some traffic laws." 

As they went to the door, Meredith remained standing by the fireplace, watching 
Elena with steady dark eyes. 

Elena made herself meet them. "Meredith... I think you should all go." 

"Do you?" Those dark eyes remained on hers unwaveringly, as if trying to pierce 
through and read her mind. But Meredith did not ask any other questions. After a 

Page 24 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
moment she nodded, and followed Matt and Bonnie without a word. 

When Elena heard the door at the bottom of the staircase close, she hastily 
righted a lamp that lay overturned by the bedside and plugged it in. Now, at last, she 
could take stock of Stefan's injuries. 

His color seemed worse than before; he was literally almost as white as the sheets 
below him. His lips were white, too, and Elena suddenly thought of Thomas Fell, the 
founder of Fell's Church. Or, rather, of Thomas Fell's statue, lying beside his wife's 
on the stone lid of their tomb. Stefan was the color of that marble. 

The cuts and gashes on his hands showed livid purple, but they were no longer 
bleeding. She gently turned his head to look at his neck. 

And there it was. She touched the side of her own neck automatically, as if to 
verify the resemblance. But Stefan's marks were not small punctures. They were 
deep, savage tears in the flesh. He looked as if he had been mauled by some animal 
that had tried to rip out his throat. 

White-hot anger blazed through Elena again. And with it, hatred. She realized that 
despite her disgust and fury, she had not really hated Damon before. Not really. But 
now... now, she hated. She loathed him with an intensity of emotion that she had 
never felt for anyone else in her life. She wanted to hurt him, to make him pay. If 
she'd had a wooden stake at that moment, she would have hammered it through 
Damon's heart without regret. 

But just now she had to think of Stefan. He was so terrifyingly still. That was the 
hardest thing to bear, the lack of purpose or resistance in his body, the emptiness. 
That was it. It was as if he had vacated this form and left her with an empty vessel. 

"Stefan!" Shaking him did nothing. With one hand on the center of his cold chest, 
she tried to detect a heartbeat. If there was one, it was too faint to feel. 

Keep calm, Elena, she told herself, pushing back the part of her mind that wanted 


to panic. The part that was saying, "What if he's dead? What if he's really dead, and 
nothing you can do will save him?" 

to panic. The part that was saying, "What if he's dead? What if he's really dead, and 
nothing you can do will save him?" 

The pain made her gasp. After an instant, blood began welling out of the cut, 
dripping down her finger like wax down a candlestick. Quickly, she knelt by Stefan 
and put her finger to his lips. 

With her other hand, she clasped his unresponsive one, feeling the hardness of the 
silver ring he wore. Motionless as a statue herself, she knelt there and waited. 

She almost missed the first tiny flicker of response. Her eyes were fixed on his 
face, and she caught the minute lifting of his chest only in her peripheral vision. But 

Page 25 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
then the lips beneath her finger quivered and parted slightly, and he swallowed 
reflexively. 

"That's it," Elena whispered. "Come on, Stefan." 

His eyelashes fluttered, and with dawning joy she felt his fingers return the 
pressure of hers. He swallowed again. 

"Yes." She waited until his eyes blinked and slowly opened before sitting back. 
Then she fumbled one-handed with the high neck of her sweater, folding it out of the 
way. 

Those green eyes were dazed and heavy, but as stubborn as she had ever seen 
them. "No," Stefan said, his voice a cracked whisper. 

"You have to, Stefan. The others are coming back and bringing a nurse with 
them. I had to agree to that. And if you're not well enough to convince her you don't 
need a hospital..." She left the sentence unfinished. She herself didn't know what a 
doctor or lab technician would find examining Stefan. But she knew he knew, and 
that it made him afraid. 

But Stefan only looked more obstinate, turning his face away from her. "Can't," 
he whispered. "It's too dangerous. Already took... too much... last night." 

Could it have been only last night? It seemed a year ago. "Will it kill me?" she 
asked. "Stefan, answer me! Will it kill me?" 

"No..." His voice was sullen. "But-" 

"Then we have to do it. Don't argue with me!" Bending over him, holding his 
hand in hers, Elena could feel his overpowering need. She was amazed that he was 
even trying to resist. It was like a starving man standing before a banquet, unable to 
take his eyes from the steaming dishes, but refusing to eat. 

"No," Stefan said again, and Elena felt frustration surge through her. He was the 
only person she'd ever met who was as stubborn as she was. 

"Yes. And if you won't cooperate I'll cut something else, like my wrist." She had 


been pressing her finger into the sheet to staunch the blood; now she held it up to 
him. 

been pressing her finger into the sheet to staunch the blood; now she held it up to 
him. 

"It's all right," she whispered. She drew the finger across his lips again, feeling 
them open to take it in; then, she leaned over him and shut her eyes. 

His mouth was cool and dry as it touched her throat. His hand cupped the back 
of her neck as his lips sought the two little punctures already there. Elena willed 

Page 26 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
herself not to recoil at the brief sting of pain. Then she smiled. 

Before, she had felt his agonizing need, his driving hunger. Now, through the 
bond they shared, she felt only fierce joy and satisfaction. Deep satisfaction as the 
hunger was gradually assuaged. 

Her own pleasure came from giving, from knowing that she was sustaining Stefan 
with her own life. She could sense the strength flowing into him. 

In time, she felt the intensity of the need lessen. Still, it was by no means gone, 
and she could not understand when Stefan tried to push her away. 

"That's enough," he grated, forcing her shoulders up. Elena opened her eyes, her 
dreamy pleasure broken. His own eyes were green as mandrake leaves, and in his 
face she saw the fierce hunger of the predator. 

"It isn't enough. You're still weak-" 

"It's enough for you." He pushed at her again, and she saw something like 
desperation spark in those green eyes. "Elena, if I take much more, you will begin to 
change. And if you don't move away, if you don't move away from me right now... 
" 

Elena withdrew to the foot of the bed. She watched him sit up and adjust the dark 
robe. In the lamplight, she saw that his skin had regained some color, a slight flush 
glazing its pallor. His hair was drying into a tumbled sea of dark waves. 

"I missed you," she said softly. Relief throbbed within her suddenly, an ache that 
was almost as bad as the fear and tension had been. Stefan was alive; he was talking 
to her. Everything was going to be all right after all. 

"Elena..." Their eyes met and she was held by green fire. Unconsciously, she 
moved toward him, and then stopped as he laughed aloud. 

"I've never seen you look like this before," he said, and she looked down at 
herself. Her shoes and jeans were caked with red mud, which was also liberally 
smeared over the rest of her. Her jacket was torn and leaking its down stuffing. She 
had no doubt that her face was smudged and dirty, and she knew her hair was 
tangled and straggly. Elena Gilbert, immaculate fashion plate of Robert E. Lee, was a 
mess. 

"I like it," Stefan said, and this time she laughed with him. 


They were still laughing as the door opened. Elena stiffened alertly, twitching at 
her turtleneck, glancing around the room for evidence that might betray them. Stefan 
sat up straighter and licked his lips.

Page 27 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
"So you're the one afraid of doctors," she said. 

Stefan looked disconcerted for a moment; then, he recovered. "It's sort of a 
childhood phobia," he said, sounding embarrassed. He glanced sideways at Elena, 
who smiled nervously and gave a tiny nod. "Anyway, I don't need one now, as you 
can see." 

"Why don't you let me be the judge of that? Your pulse is all right. In fact, it's 
surprisingly slow, even for an athlete. I don't think you're hypothermic, but you're 
still chilled. Let's get a temperature." 

"No, I really don't think that's necessary." Stefan's voice was low, calming. Elena 
had heard him use that voice before, and she knew what he was trying to do. But 
Mary took not the slightest notice. 

"Open up, please." 

"Here, I'll do it," said Elena quickly, reaching to take the thermometer from Mary. 
Somehow, as she did so, the little glass tube slipped out of her hand. It fell to the 
hardwood floor and smashed into several pieces. Uh, I'm sorry! 

"It doesn't matter," Stefan said. "I'm feeling much better than I was, and I'm 
getting warmer all the time." 

Mary regarded the mess on the floor, then looked around the room, taking in its 
ransacked state. "All right," she demanded, turning around with hands on hips. 
"What's been going on here?" 

Stefan didn't even blink. "Nothing much. Mrs. Flowers is just a terrible 
housekeeper," he said, looking her straight in the eye. 

Elena wanted to laugh, and she saw that Mary did, too. The older girl grimaced 
and crossed her arms over her chest instead. "I suppose it's useless to hope for a 
straight answer," she said. "And it's clear you're not dangerously ill. I can't make you 
go to the clinic. But I'd strongly suggest you get a checkup tomorrow." 

"Thank you," said Stefan, which, Elena noticed, was not the same as agreeing. 

"Elena, you look as if you could use a doctor," said Bonnie. "You're white as a 
ghost." 

"I'm just tired," Elena said. "It's been a long day." 

"My advice is to go home and go to bed- and stay there," Mary said. "You're 
not anemic, are you?" 


Elena resisted the impulse to put a hand to her cheek. Was she so pale? "No, I'm 
just tired," she repeated. "We can go home now, if Stefan's all right." 

Page 28 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
Elena resisted the impulse to put a hand to her cheek. Was she so pale? "No, I'm 
just tired," she repeated. "We can go home now, if Stefan's all right." 

"Good-bye. Take care of yourself," Elena said aloud as she hugged him. She 
whispered, "Why didn't you use your Powers on Mary?" 

"I did," he said grimly in her ear. "Or at least I tried. I must still be weak. Don't 
worry; it'll pass. 

"Of course, it will," said Elena, but her stomach lurched. "Are you sure you 
should be alone, though? What if-" 

"I'll be fine. You're the one who shouldn't be alone." Stefan's voice was soft but 
urgent. "Elena, I didn't get a chance to warn you. You were right about Damon being 
in Fell's Church." 

"I know. He did this to you, didn't he?" Elena didn't mention that she'd gone 
searching for him. 

"I-don't remember. But he's dangerous. Keep Bonnie and Meredith with you 
tonight, Elena. I don't want you alone. And make sure no one invites a stranger into 
your house." 

"We're going straight to bed," Elena promised, smiling at him. "We won't be 
inviting anybody in." 

"Make sure of it." There was no flippancy in his tone at all, and she nodded 
slowly. 

"I understand, Stefan. We'll be careful." 

"Good." They kissed, a mere brushing of lips, but their joined hands separated 
only reluctantly. "Tell the others 'thank you'," he said. 

"I will." 

The five of them regrouped outside the boarding house, Matt offering to drive 
Mary home so Bonnie and Meredith could go back with Elena. Mary was still clearly 
suspicious about the night's goings-on, and Elena couldn't blame her. She also 
couldn't think. She was too tired. 

"He said to say 'thanks' to all of you," she remembered after Matt had left. 

"He's... welcome," Bonnie said, splitting the words with an enormous yawn as 
Meredith opened the car door for her. 

Meredith said nothing. She had been very quiet since leaving Elena alone with 
Stefan. 

Bonnie laughed suddenly. "One thing we all forgot about," she said. "The 
prophecy." 

Page 29 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
"What prophecy?" said Elena. 


"About the bridge. The one you say I said. Well, you went to the bridge and 
Death wasn't waiting there after all. Maybe you misunderstood the words." 

"About the bridge. The one you say I said. Well, you went to the bridge and 
Death wasn't waiting there after all. Maybe you misunderstood the words." 

"Well, then, maybe it's another bridge. Or... mmm..." Bonnie snuggled down in 
her coat, shutting her eyes, and didn't bother to finish. 

But Elena's mind completed the sentence for her. Or another time. 

An owl hooted outside as Meredith started the car.

November 2, Saturday 

Dear Diary, 

This morning I woke up and felt so strange. I don't know how to describe it. On 
the one hand, I was so weak that when I tried to stand up my muscles wouldn't 
support me. But on the other hand I felt... pleasant. So comfortable, so relaxed. As 
if I were floating on a bed of golden light. I didn't care if I never moved again. 

Then I remembered Stefan, and I tried to get up, but Aunt Judith put me back 
to bed. She said Bonnie and Meredith had left hours ago, and that I'd been so fast 
asleep they couldn't wake me. She said what I needed was rest. 

So here I am. Aunt Judith brought the TV in, but I don't care about watching it. 
I'd rather lie here and write, or just lie here. 

I'm expecting Stefan to call. He told me he would. Or maybe he didn't. I can't 
remember. When he does call I have to 

November 3, Sunday (10:30 prev.m.)

I've just read over yesterday's entry and I'm shocked. What was wrong with me? 
I broke off in the middle of a sentence, and now I don't even know what I was 
going to say. And I didn't explain about my new diary or anything. I must have 
been completely spaced out. 

Anyway, this is the official start of my new diary. I bought this blank book at the 
drugstore. It's not as beautiful as the other one, but it will have to do. I've given up 
hope of ever seeing my old one again. Whoever stole it isn't going to bring it back. 
But when I think of them reading it, all my inner thoughts and my feelings about 

Page 30 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
Stefan, I want to kill them. While simultaneously dying of humiliation myself. 

I'm not ashamed of the way I feel about Stefan. But it's private. And there are 
things in there, about the way it is when we kiss, when he holds me, that I know he 
wouldn't want anybody else to read. 

Of course, it hasn't got anything about his secret in it. I hadn't found that out 
yet. It wasn't until I did that I really understood him, and we got together, really 
together, at last. Now we're part of each other. I feel as if I've been waiting for him 
all my life. 

Maybe you think I'm terrible for loving him, considering what he is. He can be 
violent, and I know there are some things in his past that he's ashamed of. But he 
could never be violent toward me, and the past is over. He has so much guilt and 
he hurts so much inside. I want to heal him. 

I don't know what will happen now; I'm just so glad that he's safe. I went to the 
boarding house today and found out that the police had been there yesterday. 
Stefan was still weak and couldn't use his Powers to get rid of them, but they 
didn't accuse him of anything. They just asked questions. Stefan says they acted 


friendly, which makes me suspicious. What all the questions really boil down to is: 
where were you on the night the old man was attacked under the bridge, and the 
night Vickie Bennett was attacked in the ruined church, and the night Mr. Tanner 
was killed at school? 

friendly, which makes me suspicious. What all the questions really boil down to is: 
where were you on the night the old man was attacked under the bridge, and the 
night Vickie Bennett was attacked in the ruined church, and the night Mr. Tanner 
was killed at school? 

Stefan and I talked about that, and about other things. It was so good to be 
with him again, even if he did look white and tired. He still doesn't remember how 
Thursday night ended, but most of it is just as I suspected. Stefan went to find 
Damon Thursday night after he took me home. They argued. Stefan ended up 
half-dead in a well. It doesn't take a genius to figure out what happened in 
between. 

I still haven't told him that I went looking for Damon in the graveyard Friday 
morning. I suppose I'd better do it tomorrow. I know he's going to be upset, 
especially when he hears what Damon said to me. 

Well, that's all. I'm tired. This diary is going to be well-hidden, for obvious 
reasons. 

Elena paused and looked at the last line on the page. Then she added: 

P.S. I wonder who our new European history teacher will be? 
She tucked the diary under her mattress and turned out the light. 
Page 31 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
Elena walked down the hallway in a curious vacuum. At school she was usually 
peppered with greetings from all sides; it was "hi, Elena," after "hi, Elena," wherever 
she went. But today eyes slid away furtively as she approached, or people suddenly 
became very busy doing something that required them to keep their backs to her. It 
had been happening all day long. 

She paused in the doorway of the European history classroom. There were 
several students already sitting down, and at the chalkboard was a stranger. 

He looked almost like a student himself. He had sandy hair, worn a little long, and 
the build of an athlete. Across the board he had written "Alaric K. Saltzman." As he 
turned around, Elena saw that he also had a boyish smile. 

He went on smiling as Elena sat down and other students filed in. Stefan was 


among them, and his eyes met Elena's as he took his seat beside her, but they didn't 
speak. No one was talking. The room was dead silent. 

among them, and his eyes met Elena's as he took his seat beside her, but they didn't 
speak. No one was talking. The room was dead silent. 

The last two people to come in were Caroline Forbes and Tyler Smallwood. They 
walked in together, and Elena didn't like the look on Caroline's face. She knew that 
catlike smile and those narrowed green eyes all too well. Tyler's handsome, rather 
fleshy features were shining with satisfaction. The discoloration under his eyes 
caused by Stefan's fist was almost gone. 

"Okay, to start off, why don't we put all these desks in a circle?" 

Elena's attention snapped back to the stranger at the front of the room. He was 
still smiling. 

"Come on, let's do it. That way we can all see each other's faces when we talk," 
he said. 

Silently, the students obeyed. The stranger didn't sit at Mr. Tanner's desk; 
instead, he pulled a chair to the circle and straddled it backward. 

"Now," he said. "I know you all must be curious about me. My name's on the 
board: Alaric K. Saltzman. But I want you to call me Alaric. I'll tell you a little more 
about me later, but first I want to give you a chance to talk. 

"Today's probably a difficult day for most of you. Someone you cared about is 
gone, and that must hurt. I want to give you a chance to open up and share those 
feelings with me and with your classmates. I want you to try to get in touch with the 
pain. Then we can start to build our own relationship on trust. Now who would like 
to go first?" 

They stared at him. No one so much as moved an eyelash. 

Page 32 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
"Well, let's see... what about you?" Still smiling, he gestured encouragingly to a 
pretty, fair-haired girl. "Tell us your name and how you feel about what's happened." 

Flustered, the girl stood. "My name's Sue Carson, and, uh..." She took a deep 
breath and went doggedly on. "And I feel scared. Because whoever this maniac is, 
he's still loose. And next time it could be me." She sat down. 

"Thank you, Sue. I'm sure a lot of your classmates share your concern. Now, do 
I understand that some of you were actually there when this tragedy occurred?" 

Desks creaked as students shifted uneasily. 

But Tyler Smallwood stood up, his lips drawing back from strong white teeth in a 
smile. 

"Most of us were there," he said, and his eyes flickered toward Stefan. Elena 
could see other people following his gaze. "I got there right after Bonnie discovered 
the body. And what I feel is concern for the community. There's a dangerous killer 
on the streets, and so far nobody's done anything to stop him. And-" He broke 
off. Elena wasn't sure how, but she felt Caroline had signaled him to do it. Caroline 


tossed back gleaming auburn hair and recrossed her long legs as Tyler took his seat 
again. 

tossed back gleaming auburn hair and recrossed her long legs as Tyler took his seat 
again. 

Bonnie raised her hand slowly, then stood. "I guess I discovered the body," she 
said. "I mean, I was the first person who knew that he was really dead, and not just 
faking." 

Alaric Saltzman looked slightly startled. "Not just faking? Did he often fake being 
dead?" There were titters, and he flashed that boyish smile again. Elena turned and 
glanced at Stefan, who was frowning. 

"No-no," said Bonnie. "You see, he was a sacrifice. At the Haunted House. So 
he was covered with blood anyway, only it was fake blood. And that was partly my 
fault, because he didn't want to put it on, and I told him he had to do it. He was 
supposed to be a Bloody Corpse. But he kept saying it was too messy, and it wasn't 
until Stefan came and argued with him-" She stopped. "I mean, we talked to him 
and he finally agreed to do it, and then the Haunted House started. And a little while 
later I noticed that he wasn't sitting up and scaring the kids like he was supposed to, 
and I went over and asked him what was wrong. And he didn't answer. He just-he 
just kept staring at the ceiling. And then I touched him and he-it was terrible. His 
head just sort of flopped ..." Bonnie's voice wavered and gave out. She gulped. 

Elena was standing up, and so were Stefan and Matt and a few other people. 
Elena reached over to Bonnie. 

"Bonnie, it's okay. Bonnie, don't; it's okay." 

Page 33 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
"And blood got all over my hands. There was blood everywhere, so much blood 
..." She sniffed hysterically. 

"Okay, time out," Alaric Saltzman said. "I'm sorry; I didn't mean to distress you 
so much. But I think you need to work through these feelings sometime in the future. 
It's clear that this has been a pretty devastating experience." 

He stood up and paced around the center of the circle, his hands opening and 
shutting nervously. Bonnie was still sniffling softly. 

"I know," he said, the boyish smile coming back full force. "I'd like to get our 
student-teacher relationship off to a good start, away from this whole atmosphere. 
How about if you all come around to my place this evening, and we can all talk 
informally? Maybe just get to know each other, maybe talk about what happened. 
You can even bring a friend if you want. How about it?" 

There was another thirty seconds or so of staring. Then someone said, "Your 
place?" 

"Yes... oh, I'm forgetting. Stupid of me. I'm staying at the Ramsey house, on 
Magnolia Avenue." He wrote the address on the board. "The Ramseys are friends of 
mine, and they loaned me the house while they're on vacation. I come from 


Charlottesville, and your principal called me Friday to ask me if I could take over 
here. I jumped at the chance. This is my first real teaching job." 

Charlottesville, and your principal called me Friday to ask me if I could take over 
here. I jumped at the chance. This is my first real teaching job." 

"Does it?" said Stefan. 

"Anyway, what do you think? Is it a plan?" Alaric Saltzman looked around at 
them. 

No one had the heart to refuse. There were scattered "yeses" and "sures." 

"Great, then it's settled. I'll provide the refreshments, and we'll all get to know 
each other. Oh, by the way..." He opened a grade book and scanned it. "In this 
class, participation makes up half your final grade." He glanced up and smiled. "You 
can go now." 

"The nerve of him," somebody muttered as Elena went out the door. Bonnie was 
behind her, but Alaric Saltzman's voice called her back. 

"Would the students who shared with us please stay behind for a minute?" 

Stefan had to leave, too. "I'd better go check about football practice," he said. 
"It's probably canceled, but I'd better make sure." 

Page 34 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
Elena was concerned. "If it's not canceled, do you think you're feeling up to it?" 


"I'll be fine," he said evasively. But she noticed that his face still looked drawn, 
and he moved as if he were in pain. "Meet you at your locker," he said. 


She nodded. When she got to her locker, she saw Caroline nearby talking to two 
other girls. Three pairs of eyes followed Elena's every move as she put away her 
books, but when Elena glanced up, two of them suddenly looked away. Only 
Caroline remained staring at her, head slightly cocked as she whispered something to 
the other girls. 


Elena had had enough. Slamming her locker, she walked straight toward the 
group. "Hello, Becky; hello, Sheila," she said. Then, with heavy emphasis: "Hello, 
Caroline." 


Becky and Sheila mumbled "hello" and added something about having to leave. 
Elena didn't even turn to watch them slink away. She kept her eyes on Caroline's. 


"What's going on?" she demanded. 


"Going on?" Caroline was obviously enjoying this, trying to draw it out as long as 
possible. "Going on with who?" 


"With you, Caroline. With everybody. Don't pretend you're not up to something, 
because I know you are. People have been avoiding me all day as if I had the plague, 
and you look like you just won the lottery. What have you done?" 


Caroline's expression of innocent inquiry slipped, and she smiled a feline smile. "I 
told you when school started that things were going to be different this year, Elena," 
she said. "I warned you your time on the throne might be running out. But it isn't my 
doing. What's happening is simply natural selection. The law of the jungle." 


. 
"And just what is happening?" 


"And just what is happening?" 


Elena's chest tightened as if Caroline had hit her. For a moment, the desire to hit 
Caroline back was almost irresistible. Then, with the blood pounding in her ears, she 
said through clenched teeth, "That isn't true. Stefan hasn't done anything. The police 
questioned him, and he was cleared." 


Caroline shrugged. Her smile now was patronizing. "Elena, I've known you since 
kindergarten," she said, "so I'll give you some advice for old times' sake: drop 
Stefan. If you do it right now you might just avoid being a complete social leper. 
Otherwise you might as well buy yourself a little bell to ring in the street." 


Rage held Elena hostage as Caroline turned and walked away, her auburn hair 
moving like liquid under the lights. Then Elena found her tongue. 


"Caroline." The other girl turned back. "Are you going to go to that party at the 


Page 35 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
Ramsey house tonight?" 
"I suppose so. Why?" 
"Because I'll be there. With Stefan. See you in the jungle." This time Elena was 
the one to turn away. 
The dignity of her exit was slightly marred when she saw a slim, shadowed figure 


at the far end of the hallway. Her step faltered for an instant, but as she drew closer 
she recognized Stefan. 
She knew the smile she gave him looked forced, and he glanced back toward the 
lockers as they walked side by side out of the school. 
"So football practice was canceled?" she said. 
He nodded. "What was that all about?" he said quietly. 
"Nothing. I asked Caroline if she was going to the party tonight." Elena tilted back 
her head to look at the gray and dismal sky. 
"And that's what you were talking about?" 


She remembered what he had told her in his room. He could see better than a 
human, and hear better, too. Well enough to catch words spoken down forty feet of 
corridor? 

"Yes," she said defiantly, still inspecting the clouds. 
"And that's what made you so angry?" 
"Yes," she said again, in the same tone. 
She could feel his eyes on her. "Elena, that's not true." 
"Well, if you can read my mind, you don't need to ask me questions, do you?" 
They were facing each other now. Stefan was tense, his mouth set in a grim line. 


"You know I wouldn't do that. But I thought you were the one who was so big on 


. 
honesty in relationships." 
honesty in relationships." 
"Because," said Stefan simply, brutally, "she might be right. Not about the murder 


Page 36 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
but about you. About you and me. I should have realized this would happen. It's not 
just her, is it? I've been sensing hostility and fear all day, but I was too tired to try 
and analyze it. They think I'm the killer and they're taking it out on you." 

"What they think doesn't matter! They're wrong, and they'll realize that eventually. 
Then everything will be the way it was again." 

A wistful smile tugged at the corner of Stefan's mouth. "You really believe that, 
don't you?" He looked away, and his face hardened. "And what if they don't? What 
if it only gets worse?" 

"What are you saying?" 

"It might be better..." Stefan took a deep breath and continued, carefully. "It 
might be better if we didn't see each other for a while. If they think we're not 
together, they'll leave you alone." 

She stared at him. "And you think you could do that? Not see me or talk to me 
for however long?" 

"If it's necessary-yes. We could pretend we've broken up." His jaw was set. 

Elena stared another moment. Then she circled him and moved in closer, so close 
that they were almost touching. He had to look down at her, his eyes only a few 
inches from her own. 

"There is," she said, "only one way I'm going to announce to the rest of the 
school that we've broken up. And that's if you tell me that you don't love me and 
you don't want to see me. Tell me that, Stefan, right now. Tell me that you don't 
want to be with me any more." 

He'd stopped breathing. He stared down at her, those green eyes striated like a 
cat's in shades of emerald and malachite and holly green. 

"Say it," she told him. "Tell me how you can get along without me, Stefan. Tell 
me-" 

She never got to finish the sentence. It was cut off as his mouth descended on 
hers.

Stefan sat in the Gilbert living room, agreeing politely with whatever it was Aunt 
Judith was saying. The older woman was uncomfortable having him here; you didn't 
need to be a mind reader to know that. But she was trying, and so Stefan was trying, 
too. He wanted Elena to be happy. 

Elena. Even when he wasn't looking at her, he was aware of her more than of 
anything else in the room. Her living presence beat against his skin like sunlight 

Page 37 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
against closed eyelids. When he actually let himself turn to face her, it was a sweet 
shock to all his senses. 

He loved her so much. He never saw her as Katherine any more; he had almost 
forgotten how much she looked like the dead girl. In any case, there were so many 
differences. Elena had the same pale gold hair and creamy skin, the same delicate 
features as Katherine, but there the resemblance ended. Her eyes, looking violet in 
the firelight just now but normally a blue as dark as lapis lazuli, were neither timid nor 
childlike as Katherine's had been. On the contrary, they were windows to her soul, 
which shone like an eager flame behind them. Elena was Elena, and her image had 
replaced Katherine's gentle ghost in his heart. 

But her very strength made their love dangerous. He hadn't been able to resist her 
last week when she'd offered him her blood. Granted, he might have died without it, 
but it had been far too soon for Elena's own safety. For the hundredth time, his eyes 
moved over Elena's face, searching for the telltale signs of change. Was that creamy 
skin a little paler? Was her expression slightly more remote? 

They would have to be careful from now on. He would have to be more careful. 
Make sure to feed often, satisfy himself with animals, so he wouldn't be tempted. 
Never let the need get too strong. Now that he thought of it, he was hungry right 
now. The dry ache, the burning, was spreading along his upper jaw, whispering 
through his veins and capillaries. He should be out in the woods-senses alert to 
catch the slightest crackle of dry twigs, muscles ready for the chase-not here by a 
fire watching the tracery of pale blue veins in Elena's throat. 

That slim throat turned as Elena looked at him. 

"Do you want to go to that party tonight? We can take Aunt Judith's car," she 
said. 

"But you ought to stay for dinner first," said Aunt Judith quickly. 

"We can pick up something on the way." Elena meant they could pick up 
something for her, Stefan thought. He himself could chew and swallow ordinary 
food if he had to, though it did him no good, and he had long since lost any taste for 
it. No, his... appetites... were more particular now, he thought. And if they went to 
this party, it would mean hours more before he could feed. But he nodded 
agreement to Elena. 

"If you want to," he said. 


She did want to; she was set on it. He'd seen that from the beginning. "All right 
then, I'd better change." 

She did want to; she was set on it. He'd seen that from the beginning. "All right 
then, I'd better change." 

She glanced through the doorway, to the empty living room, and said, "It's all 
right. They're almost healed already. See?" She tugged her lacy collar down, twisting 

Page 38 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
her head to one side. 
Stefan stared, mesmerized, at the two round marks on the fine-grained skin. They 


were a very light, translucent burgundy color, like much-watered wine. He set his 
teeth and forced his eyes away. Looking much longer at that would drive him crazy. 
"That wasn't what I meant," he said brusquely. 
The shining veil of her hair fell over the marks again, hiding them. "Oh." 
"Come in!" 
As they did, walking into the room, conversations stopped. Elena looked at the 


faces turned toward them, at the curious, furtive eyes and the wary expressions. Not 


the kind of looks she was used to getting when she made an entrance. 
It was another student who'd opened the door for them; Alaric Saltzman was 
nowhere in sight. But Caroline was, seated on a bar stool, which showed off her legs 
to their best advantage. She gave Elena a mocking look and then made some remark 
to a boy on her right. He laughed. 


Elena could feel her smile start to go painful, while a flush crept up toward her 
face. Then a familiar voice came to her. 


"Elena, Stefan! Over here." 
Gratefully, she spotted Bonnie sitting with Meredith and Ed Goff on a loveseat in 
the corner. She and Stefan settled on a large ottoman opposite them, and she heard 
conversations start to pick up again around the room. 


By tacit agreement, no one mentioned the awkwardness of Elena and Stefan's 


arrival. Elena was determined to pretend that everything was as usual. 
And Bonnie and Meredith were backing her. "You look great," said Bonnie 
warmly. "I just love that red sweater." 


"She does look nice. Doesn't she, Ed?" said Meredith, and Ed, looking vaguely 


startled, agreed. 
"So your class was invited to this, too," Elena said to Meredith. "I thought maybe 
it was just seventh period." 


"I don't know if invited is the word." replied Meredith dryly. "Considering that 
participation is half our grade." 


"Do you think he was serious about that? He couldn't be serious," put in Ed. 
. 
Elena shrugged. "He sounded serious to me. Where's Ray?" she asked Bonnie. 


Elena shrugged. "He sounded serious to me. Where's Ray?" she asked Bonnie. 


Page 39 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
That was true. The Ramsey living room was packed, and from what Elena could 
see the crowd flowed into the dining room, the front parlor, and probably the kitchen 
as well. Elbows kept brushing Elena's hair as people circulated behind her. 

"What did Saltzman want with you after class?" Stefan was saying. 

"Alaric," Bonnie corrected primly. "He wants us to call him Alaric. Oh, he was 
just being nice. He felt awful for making me relive such an agonizing experience. He 
didn't know exactly how Mr. Tanner died, and he hadn't realized I was so sensitive. 
Of course, he's incredibly sensitive himself, so he understands what it's like. He's an 
Aquarius." 

"With a moon rising in pickup lines," said Meredith under her breath. "Bonnie you 
don't believe that garbage, do you? He's a teacher; he shouldn't be trying that out on 
students." 

"He wasn't trying anything out! He said exactly the same thing to Tyler and Sue 
Carson. He said we should form a support group for each other or write an essay 
about that night to get our feelings out. He said teenagers are all very impressionable 
and he didn't want the tragedy to have a lasting impact on our lives." 

"Oh, brother," said Ed, and Stefan turned a laugh into a cough. He wasn't 
amused, though, and his question to Bonnie hadn't been just idle curiosity. Elena 
could tell; she could feel it radiating from him. Stefan felt about Alaric Saltzman the 
way that most of the people in this room felt about Stefan. Wary and mistrustful. 

"It was strange, him acting as if the party was a spontaneous idea in our class," 
she said, responding unconsciously to Stefan's unspoken words, "when obviously it 
had been planned." 

"What's even stranger is the idea that the school would hire a teacher without 
telling him how the previous teacher died," said Stefan. "Everyone was talking about 
it; it must have been in the papers." 

"But not all the details," said Bonnie firmly. "In fact, there are things the police 
still haven't let out, because they think it might help them catch the killer. For 
instance," she dropped her voice, "do you know what Mary said? Dr. Feinberg was 
talking to the guy who did the autopsy, the medical examiner. And he said that there 
was no blood left in the body at all. Not a drop." 

Elena felt an icy wind blow through her, as if she stood once again in the 
graveyard. She couldn't speak. But Ed said, "Where'd it go?" 

"Well, all over the floor, I suppose," said Bonnie calmly. "All over the altar and 
everything. That's what the police are investigating now. But it's unusual for a corpse 
not to have any blood left; usually there's some that settles down on the underside of 
the body. Postmortem lividity, it's called. It looks like big purple bruises. What's 
wrong?" 



Page 40 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
"Your incredible sensitivity has me ready to throw up," said Meredith in a 
strangled voice. "Could we possibly talk about something else?" 

"Your incredible sensitivity has me ready to throw up," said Meredith in a 
strangled voice. "Could we possibly talk about something else?" 

"Have the investigators come to any conclusions from what they've learned? Are 
they any closer to finding the killer?" 

"I don't know," said Bonnie, and then she brightened. "That's right, Elena, you 
said you knew-" 

"Shut up, Bonnie," said Elena desperately. If there ever were a place not to 
discuss this, it was in a crowded room surrounded by people who hated Stefan. 
Bonnie's eyes widened, and then she nodded, subsiding. 

Elena could not relax, though. Stefan hadn't killed Mr. Tanner, and yet the same 
evidence that would lead to Damon could as easily lead to him. And would lead to 
him, because no one but she and Stefan knew of Damon's existence. He was out 
there, somewhere, in the shadows. Waiting for his next victim. Maybe waiting for 
Stefan-or for her. 

"I'm hot," she said abruptly. "I think I'll go see what kinds of refreshments Alaric 
has provided." 

Stefan started to rise, but Elena waved him back down. He wouldn't have any use 
for potato chips and punch. And she wanted to be alone for a few minutes, to be 
moving instead of sitting, to calm herself. 

Being with Meredith and Bonnie had given her a false sense of security. Leaving 
them, she was once again confronted by sidelong glances and suddenly turned 
backs. This time it made her angry. She moved through the crowd with deliberate 
insolence, holding any eye she accidentally caught. I'm already notorious, she 
thought. I might as well be brazen, too. 

She was hungry. In the Ramsey dining room someone had set up an assortment 
of finger foods that looked surprisingly good. Elena took a paper plate and dropped 
a few carrot sticks on it, ignoring the people around the bleached oak table. She 
wasn't going to speak to them unless they spoke first. She gave her full attention to 
the refreshments, leaning past people to select cheese wedges and Ritz crackers, 
reaching in front of them to pluck grapes, ostentatiously looking up and down the 
whole array to see if there was anything she'd missed. 

She'd succeeded in riveting everyone's attention, something she knew without 
raising her eyes. She bit delicately down on a bread stick, holding it between her 
teeth like a pencil, and turned from the table. 

"Mind if I have a bite?" 

Shock snapped her eyes wide open and froze her breath. Her mind jammed, 
refusing to acknowledge what was going on, and leaving her helpless, vulnerable, in 

Page 41 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
the face of it. But though rational thought had disappeared, her senses went right on 
recording mercilessly: dark eyes dominating her field of vision, a whiff of some kind

of cologne in her nostrils, two long fingers tilting her chin up. Damon leaned in, and, 
neatly and precisely, bit off the other end of the bread stick. 


of cologne in her nostrils, two long fingers tilting her chin up. Damon leaned in, and, 
neatly and precisely, bit off the other end of the bread stick. 


His eyes were still on hers. Elena got in a breath at last and opened her mouth; she 
wasn't sure what for. To scream, probably. To warn all these people to run out into 
the night. Her heart was pounding like a triphammer, her vision blurred. 


"Easy, easy." He took the plate from her and then somehow got hold of her wrist. 
He was holding it lightly, the way Mary had felt for Stefan's pulse. As she continued 
to stare and gasp, he stroked it with his thumb, as if comforting her. "Easy. It's all 
right." 


What are you doing here? she thought. The scene around her seemed eerily 
bright and unnatural. It was like one of those nightmares when everything is ordinary, 
just like waking life, and then suddenly something grotesque happens. He was going 
to kill them all. 


"Elena? Are you okay?" Sue Carson was talking to her, gripping her shoulder. 


"I think she choked on something," Damon said, releasing Elena's wrist. "But 
she's all right now. Why don't you introduce us?" 


He was going to kill them all... 


"Elena, this is Damon, um..." Sue spread an apologetic hand, and Damon 
finished for her. 


"Smith." He lifted a paper cup toward Elena. "La vita." 


"What are you doing here?" she whispered. 


"He's a college student," Sue volunteered, when it became apparent that Damon 
wasn't going to answer. "From-University of Virginia, was it? William and Mary?" 


"Among other places," Damon said, still looking at Elena. He hadn't glanced at 
Sue once. "I like to travel." 


The world had snapped into place again around Elena, but it was a chilling world. 
There were people on every side, watching this exchange with fascination, keeping 
her from speaking freely. But they were also keeping her safe. For whatever reason, 
Damon was playing a game, pretending to be one of them. And while the 
masquerade went on, he wouldn't do anything to her in front of a crowd... she 
hoped. 


Page 42 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
A game. But he was making up the rules. He was standing here in the Ramseys' 
dining room playing with her. 


"He's just down for a few days," Sue was continuing helpfully. "Visiting-friends, 
did you say? Or relatives?" 


. 
"Yes," said Damon. 


"Yes," said Damon. 


"Luck has very little to do with it," said Damon. "Do you like dancing?" 


"What's your major?" 


He smiled at her. "American folklore. Did you know, for instance, that a mole on 
the neck means you'll be wealthy? Do you mind if I check?" 


"I mind." The voice came from behind Elena. It was clear and cold and quiet. 
Elena had heard Stefan speak in that tone only once: when he had found Tyler trying 
to assault her in the graveyard. Damon's fingers stilled on her throat, and, released 
from his spell, she stepped back. 


"But do you matter?" he said. 


The two of them faced each other under the faintly flickering yellow light of the 
brass chandelier. 


Elena was aware of layers of her own thoughts, like a parfait. Everyone's staring; 
this must be better than the movies... I didn't realize Stefan was taller... There's 
Bonnie and Meredith wondering what's going on... Stefan's angry but he's still weak, 
still hurting... If he goes for Damon now, he'll lose... 


And in front of all these people. Her thoughts came to a clattering halt as 
everything fell into place. That was what Damon was here for, to make Stefan attack 
him, apparently unprovoked. No matter what happened after that, he won. If Stefan 
drove him away, it would just be more proof of Stefan's "tendency toward 
violence." More evidence for Stefan's accusers. And if Stefan lost the fight... 


It would mean his life, thought Elena. Oh, Stefan, he's so much stronger right 
now; please don't do it. Don't play into his hands. 


He wants to kill you; he's just looking for a chance. 


She made her limbs move, though they were stiff and awkward as a marionette's. 
"Stefan," she said, taking his cold hand in hers, "let's go home." 


She could feel the tension in his body, like an electric current running underneath 
his skin. At this moment, he was completely focused on Damon, and the light in his 
eyes was like fire reflecting off a dagger blade. She didn't recognize him in this 
mood, didn't know him. He frightened her. 


Page 43 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
"Stefan," she said, calling to him as if she were lost in fog and couldn't find him. 
"Stefan, please." 

And slowly, slowly, she felt him respond. She heard him breathe and felt his body 
go off alert, clicking down to some lower energy level. The deadly concentration of 
his mind was diverted and he looked at her, and saw her. 

"All right," he said softly, looking into her eyes. "Let's go." 

She kept her hands on him as they turned away, one clasping his hand, the other 


tucked inside his arm. By sheer force of will, she managed not to look over her 
shoulder as they walked away, but the skin on her back tingled and crawled as if 
expecting the stab of a knife. 

tucked inside his arm. By sheer force of will, she managed not to look over her 
shoulder as they walked away, but the skin on her back tingled and crawled as if 
expecting the stab of a knife. 

On the way out, they finally ran into their host. 

"Leaving so soon?" Alaric said. "But I haven't even had a chance to talk to you 
yet." 

He looked both eager and reproachful, like a dog that knows perfectly well it's not 
going to be taken on a walk but wags anyway. Elena felt worry blossom in her 
stomach for him and everyone else in the house. She and Stefan were leaving them 
to Damon. 

She'd just have to hope her earlier assessment was right and he wanted to 
continue the masquerade. Right now she had enough to do getting Stefan out of here 
before he changed his mind. 

"I'm not feeling very well," she said as she picked up her purse where it lay by the 
ottoman. "Sorry." She increased the pressure on Stefan's arm. It would take very 
little to get him to turn back and head for the dining room right now. 

"I'm sorry," said Alaric. "Good-bye." 

They were on the threshold before she saw the little slip of violet paper stuck into 
the side pocket of her purse. She pulled it out and unfolded it almost by reflex, her 
mind on other things. 

There was writing on it, plain and bold and unfamiliar. Just three lines. She read 
them and felt the world rock. This was too much; she couldn't deal with anything 
more. 

"What is it?" said Stefan. 

Page 44 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
"Nothing." She thrust the bit of paper back into the side pocket, pushing it down 
with her fingers. "It's nothing, Stefan. Let's get outside." 

They stepped out into driving needles of rain.

"Next time," Stefan said quietly, "I won't leave." 

Elena knew he meant it, and it terrified her. But just now her emotions were quietly 
coasting in neutral, and she didn't want to argue. 

"He was there," she said. "Inside an ordinary house full of ordinary people, just 
as if he had every right to be. I wouldn't have thought he would dare." 

"Why not?" Stefan said briefly, bitterly. "I was there in a ordinary house full of 
ordinary people, just as if I had every right to be." 

"I didn't mean that the way it sounded. It's just that the only other time I've seen 
him in public was at the Haunted House when he was wearing a mask and costume, 
and it was dark. Before that it was always somewhere deserted, like the gym that 
night I was there alone, or the graveyard..." 

She knew as soon as she said that last part that it was a mistake. She still hadn't 
told Stefan about going to find Damon three days ago. In the driver's seat, he 
stiffened. 

"Or the graveyard?" 

"Yes... I meant that day Bonnie and Meredith and I got chased out. I'm assuming 
it must have been Damon who chased us. And the place was deserted except for the 
three of us." 

Why was she lying to him? Because, a small voice in her head answered grimly, 
otherwise he might snap. Knowing what Damon had said to her, what he had 
promised was in store, might be all that was needed to send Stefan over the edge. 

I can never tell him, she realized with a sick jolt. Not about that time or about 
anything Damon does in the future. If he fights Damon, he dies. 

Then he'll never know, she promised herself. No matter what I have to do, I'll 
keep them from fighting each other over me. No matter what. 

For a moment, apprehension chilled her. 

Five hundred years ago, Katherine had tried to keep them from fighting, and had 
succeeded only in forcing them into a death match. But she wouldn't make the same 
mistake, Elena told herself fiercely. Katherine's methods had been stupid and 
childish. Who else but a stupid child would kill herself in the hope that the two rivals 

Page 45 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
for her hand would become friends? It had been the worst mistake of the whole 
sorry affair. Because of it, the rivalry between Stefan and Damon had turned into 
implacable hatred. And what's more, Stefan had lived with the guilt of it ever since; 
he blamed himself for Katherine's stupidity and weakness. 

Groping for another subject, she said, "Do you think someone invited him in?" 

"Obviously, since he was in." 


"Then it's true about-people like you. You have to be invited in. But Damon got 
into the gym without an invitation." 

"Then it's true about-people like you. You have to be invited in. But Damon got 
into the gym without an invitation." 

"But I didn't invite you into my house." 

"Yes, you did. That first night, when I drove you home, you pushed the door 
open and nodded to me. It doesn't have to be a verbal invitation. If the intent is 
there, that's enough. And the person inviting you doesn't have to be someone who 
actually lives in the house. Any human will do." 

Elena was thinking. "What about a houseboat?" 

"Same thing. Although running water can be a barrier in itself. For some of us, it's 
almost impossible to cross." 

Elena had a sudden vision of herself and Meredith and Bonnie racing for Wickery 
Bridge. Because somehow she had known that if they got to the other side of the 
river they'd be safe from whatever was after them. 

"So that's why," she whispered. It still didn't explain how she'd known, though. It 
was as if the knowledge had been put into her head from some outside source. Then 
she realized something else. 

"You took me across the bridge. You can cross running water." 

"That's because I'm weak." It was said flatly, with no emotion behind it. "It's 
ironic, but the stronger your Powers are, the more you're affected by certain 
limitations. The more you belong to the dark, the more the rules of the dark bind 
you." 

"What other rules are there?" said Elena. She was beginning to see the glimmer of 
a plan. Or at least of the hope of a plan. 

Stefan looked at her. "Yes," he said, "I think it's time you knew. The more you 
know about Damon, the more chance you'll have of protecting yourself." 

Of protecting herself? Perhaps Stefan knew more than she thought. But as he 
turned the car onto a side street and parked, she just said, "Okay. Should I be 

Page 46 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
stocking up on garlic?" 


He laughed. "Only if you want to be unpopular. There are certain plants, though, 
that might help you. Like vervain. That's an herb that's supposed to protect you 
against bewitchment, and it can keep your mind clear even if someone is using 
Powers against you. People used to wear it around their necks. Bonnie would love it; 
it was sacred to the Druids." 


"Vervain," said Elena, tasting the unfamiliar word. "What else?" 


"Strong light, or direct sunlight, can be very painful. You'll notice the weather's 
changed." 


. 
"I've noticed," said Elena after a beat. "You mean Damon's doing that?" 


"I've noticed," said Elena after a beat. "You mean Damon's doing that?" 


"And neither do you," Elena said. "What about-well, crosses and things?" 


"No effect," said Stefan. "Except that if the person holding one believes it's a 
protection, it can strengthen their will to resist tremendously." 


"Uh... silver bullets?" 


Stefan laughed again shortly. "That's for werewolves. From what I've heard they 
don't like silver in any form. A wooden stake through the heart is still the approved 
method for my kind. There are other ways that are more or less effective, though: 
burning, beheading, driving nails through the temples. Or, best of all-" 


"Stefan!" The lonely, bitter smile on his face dismayed her. "What about changing 
into animals?" she said. "Before, you said that with enough Power you could do 
that. If Damon can be any animal he likes, how will we ever recognize him?" 


"Not any animal he likes. He's limited to one animal, or at the most two. Even with 
his Powers I don't think he could sustain any more than that." 


"So we keep looking out for a crow." 


"Right. You may be able to tell if he's around, too, by looking at regular animals. 
They usually don't react very well to us; they sense that we're hunters." 


"Yangtze kept barking at that crow. It was as if he knew there was something 
wrong about it," Elena remembered. "Ah... Stefan," she added in a changed tone as 
a new thought struck her, "what about mirrors? I don't remember ever seeing you in 
one." 


For a moment, he didn't answer. Then he said, "Legend has it that mirrors reflect 
the soul of the person who looks into them. That's why primitive people are afraid of 
mirrors; they're afraid that their souls will be trapped and stolen. My kind is 
supposed to have no reflection-because we have no souls." Slowly, he reached up 


Page 47 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
to the rearview mirror and tilted it downward, adjusting it so that Elena could look 
into it. In the silvered glass, she saw his eyes, lost, haunted, and infinitely sad. 

There was nothing to do but hold on to him, and Elena did. "I love you," she 
whispered. It was the only comfort she could give him. It was all they had. 

His arms tightened around her; his face was buried in her hair. "You're the 
mirror," he whispered back. 

It was good to feel him relax, tension flowing out of his body as warmth and 
comfort flowed in. She was comforted, too, a sense of peace infusing her, 
surrounding her. It was so good that she forgot to ask him what he meant until they 
were at her front door, saying good-bye. 

"I'm the mirror?" she said then, looking up at him. 


"You've stolen my soul," he said. "Lock the door behind you, and don't open it 
again tonight." Then he was gone. 

"You've stolen my soul," he said. "Lock the door behind you, and don't open it 
again tonight." Then he was gone. 

"Stefan and I went for a ride." Elena didn't like the expression on her aunt's face 
when she said that. "Is there a problem?" 

"No, no. It's just..." Aunt Judith didn't seem to know how to finish her sentence. 
"Elena, I wonder if it might be a good idea to... not see quite so much of Stefan." 

Elena went still. "You, too?" 

"It isn't that I believe the gossip," Aunt Judith assured her. "But, for your own 
sake, it might be best to get a little distance from him, to-" 

"To dump him? To abandon him because people are spreading rumors about 
him? To keep myself away from the mudslinging in case any of it sticks on me?" 
Anger was a welcome release, and the words crowded in Elena's throat, all trying to 
get out at once. "No, I don't think that's a good idea, Aunt Judith. And if it were 
Robert we were talking about, you wouldn't either. Or maybe you would!" 

"Elena, I will not have you speaking to me in that tone-" 

"I'm finished anyway!" Elena cried, and whirled blindly for the stairs. She 
managed to keep the tears back until she was in her own room with the door locked. 
Then she threw herself on the bed and sobbed. 

She dragged herself up a while later to call Bonnie. Bonnie was excited and 
voluble. What on earth did Elena mean, had anything unusual happened after she and 
Stefan left? The unusual thing was their leaving! No, that new guy Damon hadn't said 
anything about Stefan afterward; he'd just hung around for a while and then 
disappeared. No, Bonnie hadn't seen if he left with anybody. Why? Was Elena 

Page 48 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
jealous? Yes, that was meant to be a joke. But, really, he was gorgeous, wasn't he? 
Almost more gorgeous than Stefan, that is assuming you liked dark hair and eyes. Of 
course, if you liked lighter hair and hazel eyes... 


Elena immediately deduced that Alaric Saltzman's eyes were hazel. 


She got off the phone at last and only then remembered the note she'd found in 
her purse. She should have asked Bonnie if anyone had gone near her purse while 
she was in the dining room. But then, Bonnie and Meredith had been in the dining 
room part of the time themselves. Someone might have done it then. 


The very sight of the violet paper made her taste tin at the back of her mouth. She 
could hardly bear to look at it. But now that she was alone she had to unfold it and 
read it again, all the time hoping that somehow this time the words might be different, 
that she might have been mistaken before. 


But they weren't different. The sharp, clean block letters stood out against the 


. 
pale background as if they were ten feet high. 


pale background as if they were ten feet high. 


Her words. From her diary. The one that had been stolen. 


The next day Meredith and Bonnie rang her doorbell. 


"Stefan called me last night," said Meredith. "He said he wanted to make sure you 
weren't walking to school alone. He's not going to be at school today, so he asked if 
Bonnie and I could come over and walk with you. 


"Escort you," said Bonnie, who was clearly in a good mood. "Chaperone you. I 
think it's terribly sweet of him to be so protective." 


"He's probably an Aquarius, too," said Meredith. "Come on, Elena, before I kill 
her to shut her up about Alaric." 


Elena walked in silence, wondering what Stefan was doing that kept him from 
school. She felt vulnerable and exposed today, as if her skin were on inside out. One 
of those days when she was ready to cry at the drop of a hat. 


On the office bulletin board was tacked a piece of violet paper. 


She should have known. She had known somewhere deep inside. The thief 
wasn't satisfied with letting her know her private words had been read. He was 
showing her they could be made public. 


She ripped the note off the board and crumpled it, but not before she glimpsed 
the words. In one glance they were seared onto her brain. 


I feel as if someone has hurt him terribly in the past and he's never gotten over 


Page 49 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
it. But I also think there's something he's afraid of, some secret he's afraid I'll find 
out. 


"Elena, what is that? What's the matter? Elena, come back here!" 


Bonnie and Meredith followed her to the nearest girls' bathroom, where she stood 
over the wastebasket shredding the note into microscopic pieces, breathing as if 
she'd just run a race. They looked at each other and then turned to survey the 
bathroom stalls. 


"Okay," said Meredith loudly, "senior privilege. You!" She rapped on the only 
closed door. "Come out." 


Some rustling, then a bewildered freshman emerged. "But I didn't even-" 


"Out. Outside," Bonnie ordered. "And you," she said to the girl washing her 
hands, "stand out there and make sure nobody comes in." 


"But why? What are you-" 


"Move, chick. If anybody comes through that door we're holding you 
responsible." 


. 
When the door was closed again, they rounded on Elena. 


When the door was closed again, they rounded on Elena. 


Elena ripped the last tiny shred of paper, caught between laughter and tears. She 
wanted to tell them everything, but she couldn't. She settled for telling them about the 
diary. 


They were as angry, as indignant, as she was. 


"It had to be someone at the party," Meredith said at last, once they had each 
expressed their opinion of the thief's character, morals, and probable destination in 
the afterlife. "But anybody there could have done it. I don't remember anyone in 
particular going near your purse, but that room was wall-to-wall people, and it could 
have happened without my noticing." 


"But why would anyone want to do this?" Bonnie put in. "Unless... Elena, the 
night we found Stefan you were hinting around at some things. You said you thought 
you knew who the killer was." 


"I don't think I know; I know. But if you're wondering if this might be connected, 
I'm not sure. I suppose it could be. The same person might have done it." 


Bonnie was horrified. "But that means the killer is a student at this school!" When 
Elena shook her head, she went on. "The only people at that party who weren't 
students were that new guy and Alaric." Her expression changed. "Alaric didn't kill 
Mr. Tanner! He wasn't even in Fell's Church then." 


Page 50 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
"I know. Alaric didn't do it." She'd gone too far to stop now; Bonnie and 
Meredith already knew too much. "Damon did." 

"That guy was the killer? The guy that kissed me?" 

"Bonnie, calm down." As always, other people's hysteria made Elena feel more in 
control. "Yes, he's the killer, and we all three have to be on guard against him. That's 
why I'm telling you. Never, never ask him into your house." 

Elena stopped, regarding the faces of her friends. They were staring at her, and 
for a moment she had the sickening feeling that they didn't believe her. That they 
were going to question her sanity. 

But all Meredith asked, in an even, detached voice, was: "Are you sure about 
this?" 

"Yes. I'm sure. He's the murderer and the one who put Stefan in the well, and he 
might be after one of us next. And I don't know if there's any way to stop him." 

"Well, then," said Meredith, lifting her eyebrows. "No wonder you and Stefan 
were in such a hurry to leave the party." 

Caroline gave Elena a vicious smirk as Elena walked into the cafeteria. But Elena 
was almost beyond noticing. 

One thing she noticed right away, though. Vickie Bennett was there. 


Vickie hadn't been to school since the night Matt and Bonnie and Meredith had 
found her wandering on the road, raving about mist and eyes and something terrible 
in the graveyard. The doctors who checked her afterward said there was nothing 
much wrong with her physically, but she still hadn't returned to Robert E. Lee. 
People whispered about psychologists and the drug treatments they were trying.

People whispered about psychologists and the drug treatments they were trying. 

It was strange to sit at a half-empty table with only Bonnie and Meredith for 
company. Usually people were crowding to get seats around the three of them. 

"We didn't finish talking this morning," Meredith said. "Get something to eat, and 
then we'll figure out what to do about those notes." 

"I'm not hungry," said Elena flatly. "And what can we do? If it's Damon, there's 
no way we can stop him. Trust me, it's not a matter for the police. That's why I 
haven't told them he's the killer. There isn't any proof, and besides, they would never 
... Bonnie, you're not listening." 

Page 51 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
"Sorry," said Bonnie, who was staring past Elena's left ear. "But something weird 
is going on up there." 


Elena turned. Vickie Bennett was standing at the front of the cafeteria, but she no 
longer seemed crumpled and subdued. She was looking around the room in a sly 
and assessing manner, smiling. 


"Well, she doesn't look normal, but I wouldn't say she was being weird, exactly," 
Meredith said. Then she added, "Wait a minute." 


Vickie was unbuttoning her cardigan. But it was the way she was doing it-with 
deliberate little flicks of her fingers, all the while looking around with that secretive 
smile- that was odd. When the last button was undone, she took the sweater 
daintily between forefinger and thumb and slid it down over first one arm and then 
the other. She dropped the sweater on the floor. 


"Weird is the word," confirmed Meredith. 


Students crossing in front of Vickie with laden trays glanced at her curiously and 
then looked back over their shoulders when they had passed. They didn't actually 
stop walking, though, until she took off her shoes. 


She did it gracefully, catching the heel of one pump on the toe of the other and 
pushing it off. Then she kicked off the second pump. 


"She can't keep going," murmured Bonnie, as Vickie's fingers moved to the 
simulated pearl buttons on her white silk blouse. 


Heads were turning; people were poking one another and gesturing. Around 
Vickie a small group had gathered, standing far enough back that they didn't interfere 
with everyone else's view. 


The white silk blouse rippled off, fluttering like a wounded ghost to the floor. 


. 
Vickie was wearing a lacy off-white slip underneath. 


Vickie was wearing a lacy off-white slip underneath. 


Vickie smiled demurely and began to unfasten clasps at her waist. Her pleated 
skirt fell to the floor. She stepped out of it and pushed it to one side with her foot. 


Somebody stood up at the back of the cafeteria and chanted, "Take it off! Take it 


off!" Other voices joined in. 


"Isn't anybody going to stop her?" fumed Bonnie. 


Elena got up. The last time she'd gone near Vickie the other girl had screamed and 
struck out at her. But now, as she got close, Vickie gave her the smile of a 


Page 52 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
conspirator. Her lips moved, but Elena couldn't make out what she was saying over 
the chanting. 
"Come on, Vickie. Let's go," she said. 


Vickie's light brown hair tossed and she plucked at the strap of her slip. 
Elena stooped to pick up the cardigan and wrap it around the girl's slender 
shoulders. As she did, as she touched Vickie, those half-closed eyes opened wide 
like a startled fawn's again. Vickie stared about her wildly, as if she'd just been 
awakened from a dream. She looked down at herself and her expression turned to 
disbelief. Pulling the cardigan around her more tightly, she backed away, shivering. 


The room was quiet again. 
"It's okay," said Elena soothingly. "Come on." 
At the sound of her voice, Vickie jumped as if touched by a live wire. She stared 
at Elena, and then she exploded into action. 
"You're one of them! I saw you! You're evil!" 
She turned and ran barefoot out of the cafeteria, leaving Elena stunned.

"Do you know what's strange about what Vickie did at school? I mean aside from 
all the obvious things," Bonnie said, licking chocolate frosting off her fingers. 

"What?" said Elena dully. 

"Well, the way she ended up, in her slip. She looked just like she did when we 
found her on the road, only then she was all scratched up, too." 

"Cat scratches, we thought," said Meredith, finishing the last bite of her cake. She 
seemed to be in one of her quiet, thoughtful moods; right now she was watching 
Elena closely. "But that doesn't seem very likely." 

Elena looked straight back at her. "Maybe she fell in some brambles," she said. 
"Now, if you guys are finished eating, do you want to see that first note?" 

They left their dishes in the sink and climbed the stairs to Elena's room. Elena felt 
herself flush as the other girls read the note. Bonnie and Meredith were her best 
friends, maybe her only friends now. She'd read them passages from her diary 
before. But this was different. It was the most humiliating feeling she'd ever had. 
"Well?" she said to Meredith. 

"The person who wrote this is five feet eleven inches tall, walks with a slight limp, 

Page 53 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
and wears a false mustache," Meredith intoned. "Sorry," she added, seeing Elena's 
face. "Not funny. Actually, there's not much to go on, is there? The writing looks 
like a guy's, but the paper looks feminine." 

"And the whole thing has sort of a feminine touch," put in Bonnie, bouncing 
slightly on Elena's bed. "Well, it does," she said defensively. "Quoting bits of your 
diary back at you is the kind of thing a woman would think of. Men don't care about 
diaries." 

"You just don't want it to be Damon," said Meredith. "I would think you'd be 
more worried about him being a psycho killer than a diary thief." 

"I don't know; killers are sort of romantic. Imagine your dying with his hands 
around your throat. He'd strangle the life out of you, and the last thing you'd see 
would be his face." Putting her own hands to her throat, Bonnie gasped and expired 
tragically, ending up draped across the bed. "He can have me anytime," she said, 
eyes still closed. 

It was on Elena's lips to say, "Don't you understand, this is serious," but instead 
she hissed in a breath. "Oh, God," she said, and ran to the window. The day was 
humid and stifling, and the window had been opened. Outside on the skeletal 
branches of the quince tree was a crow. 

Elena threw the sash down so hard that the glass rattled and tinkled. The crow 
gazed at her through the trembling panes with eyes like obsidian. Rainbows 
glimmered in its sleek black plumage. 

"Why did you say that?" she said, turning to Bonnie. 


"Hey, there's nobody out there," said Meredith gently. "Unless you count the 
birds." 

"Hey, there's nobody out there," said Meredith gently. "Unless you count the 
birds." 

"I'm sorry," said Bonnie in a small voice, after a moment. "It's just that it all 
doesn't seem real sometimes, even Mr. Tanner's being dead doesn't seem real. And 
Damon did look... well, exciting. But dangerous. I can believe he's dangerous." 

"And besides, he wouldn't squeeze your throat; he'd cut it," Meredith said. "Or at 
least that was what he did to Tanner. But the old man under the bridge had his throat 
ripped open, as if some animal had done it." Meredith looked to Elena for 
clarification. "Damon doesn't have an animal, does he?" 

"No. I don't know." Suddenly, Elena felt very tired. She was worried about 
Bonnie, about the consequences of those foolish words. 

"I can do anything to you, to you and the ones you love," she remembered. What 
might Damon do now? She didn't understand him. He was different every time they 
met. In the gym he'd been taunting, laughing at her. But the next time she would 

Page 54 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
swear that he'd been serious, quoting poetry to her, trying to get her to come away 
with him. Last week, with the icy graveyard wind lashing around him, he'd been 
menacing, cruel. And underneath his mocking words last night, she'd felt the same 
menace. She couldn't predict what he'd do next. 

But, whatever happened, she had to protect Bonnie and Meredith from him. 
Especially since she couldn't warn them properly. And what was Stefan up to? She 
needed him right now, more than anything. Where was he? 

It started that morning. 

"Let me get this straight," Matt said, leaning against the scarred body of his 
ancient Ford sedan when Stefan approached him before school. "You want to 
borrow my car." 

"Yes," Stefan said. 

"And the reason you want to borrow it is flowers. You want to get some flowers 
for Elena." 

"Yes." 

"And these particular flowers, these flowers you've just got to get, don't grow 
around here." 

"They might. But their blooming season is over this far north. And the frost 
would have finished them off anyway." 

"So you want to go down south-how far south you don't know-to find some 
of these flowers that you've just got to give to Elena." 

"Or at least some of the plants," Stefan said. "I'd rather have the actual flowers 
though." 


"And since the police still have your car, you want to borrow mine, for however 
long it takes you to go down south and find these flowers that you've just got to give 
to Elena." 

"And since the police still have your car, you want to borrow mine, for however 
long it takes you to go down south and find these flowers that you've just got to give 
to Elena." 

"Uh huh. And that's why you want my car." 

"Yes. Are you going to give it to me?" 

"Am I going to give my car to the guy who stole my girlfriend and now wants to 
take a jaunt down south to get her some kind of special flowers she's just got to 
have? Are you crazy?" Matt, who had been staring out over the roofs of the frame 
houses across the street, turned at last to look at Stefan. His blue eyes, usually 

Page 55 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
cheerful and straightforward, were full of utter disbelief, and surmounted by twisted, 
puckered brows. 


Stefan looked away. He should have known better. After everything Matt had 
already done for him, to expect more was ridiculous. Especially these days, when 
people flinched from the sound of his step and avoided his eyes when he came near. 
To expect Matt, who had the best of reasons to resent him, to do him such a favor 
with no explanation, on the basis of faith alone, really was insane. 


"No, I'm not crazy," he said quietly, and turned to go. 


"Neither am I," Matt had said. "And I'd have to be crazy to turn my car over to 
you. Hell, no. I'm going with you." 


By the time Stefan had turned back around, Matt was looking at the car instead of 
him, lower lip thrust forward in a wary, judicious pout. 


"After all," he'd said, rubbing at the flaking vinyl of the roof, "you might scratch 
the paint or something." 


Elena put the phone back on the hook. Somebody was at the boarding house, 
because somebody kept picking up the phone when it rang, but after that there was 
only silence and then the click of disconnection. She suspected it was Mrs. Flowers, 
but that didn't tell her anything about where Stefan was. Instinctively, she wanted to 
go to him. But it was dark outside, and Stefan had warned her specifically not to go 
out in the dark, especially not anywhere near the cemetery or the woods. The 
boarding house was near both. 


"No answer?" said Meredith as Elena came back and sat down on the bed. 


"She keeps hanging up on me," Elena said, and muttered something under her 
breath. 


"Did you say she was a witch?" 


"No, but it rhymes with that," said Elena. 


"Look," said Bonnie, sitting up. "If Stefan's going to call, he'll call here. There's 


. 
no reason for you to come and stay the night with me." 


no reason for you to come and stay the night with me." 


"My mom and dad and Mary are all home," Bonnie persisted. "And we lock all 
our doors and windows and everything since Mr. Tanner was murdered. This 
weekend Dad even put on extra locks. I don't see what you can do." 


Elena didn't either. But she was going just the same. 


She left a message for Stefan with Aunt Judith, telling him where she was. There 


Page 56 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
was still a lingering constraint between her and her aunt. And there would be, Elena 
thought, until Aunt Judith changed her mind about Stefan. 

At Bonnie's house, she was given a room that had belonged to one of Bonnie's 
sisters who was now in college. The first thing she did was check the window. It 
was closed and locked, and there was nothing outside that someone could climb, 
like a drainpipe or tree. As inconspicuously as possible, she also checked Bonnie's 
room and any others she could get into. Bonnie was right; they were all sealed up 
tight from the inside. Nothing from the outside could get in. 

She lay in bed a long time that night, staring at the ceiling, unable to sleep. She 
kept remembering Vickie dreamily doing a striptease in the cafeteria. What was 
wrong with the girl? She would remember to ask Stefan that next time she saw him. 

Thoughts of Stefan were pleasant, even with all the terrible things that had 
happened recently. Elena smiled in the darkness, letting her mind wander. Someday 
all this harassment would be over, and she and Stefan could plan a life together. Of 
course, he hadn't actually said anything about that, but Elena herself was sure. She 
was going to marry Stefan, or no one. And Stefan was going to marry no one but 
her... 

The transition into dreaming was so smooth and gradual that she scarcely noticed 
it. But she knew, somehow, that she was dreaming. It was as if a little part of her 
was standing aside and watching the dream like a play. 

She was sitting in a long hallway, which was covered with mirrors on one side and 
windows on the other. She was waiting for something. Then she saw a flicker of 
movement, and Stefan was standing outside the window. His face was pale and his 
eyes were hurt and angry. She went over to the window, but she couldn't hear what 
he was saying because of the glass. In one hand, he was holding a book with a blue 
velvet cover, and he kept gesturing to it and asking her something. Then he dropped 
the book and turned away. 

"Stefan, don't go! Don't leave me!" she cried. Her fingers flattened whitely on the 
glass. Then she noticed that there was a latch on one side of the window and she 
opened it, calling to him. But he had disappeared and outside she saw only swirling 
white mist. 


Disconsolately, she turned away from the window and began walking down the 
hall. 

Disconsolately, she turned away from the window and began walking down the 
hall. 

As she watched, standing still, the image suddenly whirled around and around, as 
if dancing. Horror swept over Elena. She began to run down the hall, but now all the 
reflections had a life of their own, dancing, beckoning to her, laughing at her. Just 
when she thought her heart and lungs would burst with terror, she reached the end of 
the corridor and flung open a door. 

Page 57 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
She was standing in a large and beautiful room. The lofty ceiling was intricately 
carved and inlaid with gold; the doorways were faced with white marble. Classical 
statues stood in niches along the walls. Elena had never seen a room of such 
splendor, but she knew where she was. In Renaissance Italy, when Stefan had been 
alive. 


She looked down at herself and saw she was wearing a dress like the one she'd 
had made for Halloween, the ice blue Renaissance ball gown. But this dress was a 
deep ruby red, and around her waist she wore a thin chain set with brilliant red 
stones. The same stones were in her hair. When she moved, the silk shimmered like 
flames in the light of hundreds of torches. 


At the far end of the room, two huge doors swung inward. A figure appeared 
between them. It walked toward her, and she saw that it was a young man dressed in 
Renaissance clothing, doublet and hose and fur-trimmed jerkin. 


Stefan! She started toward him eagerly, feeling the weight of her dress swing from 
the waist. But when she got closer she stopped, drawing in a sharp breath. It was 
Damon. 


He kept on walking toward her, confident, casual. He was smiling, a smile of 
challenge. Reaching her, he put one hand over his heart and bowed. Then he held 
out the hand to her as if daring her to take it. 


"Do you like dancing?" he said. Except that his lips didn't move. The voice was in 
her mind. 


Her fear drained away, and she laughed. What was wrong with her, to have ever 
been afraid of him? They understood each other very well. But instead of taking his 
hand, she turned away, the silk of the dress turning after her. She moved lightly 
toward one of the statues along the wall, not glancing back to see if he was following 
her. She knew he would. She pretended to be absorbed in the statue, moving away 
again just as he reached her, biting her lip to hold in the laughter. She felt wonderful 
right now, so alive, so beautiful. Dangerous? Of course, this game was dangerous. 
But she had always enjoyed danger. 


The next time he drew near her, she glanced at him teasingly as she turned. He 


. 
reached out, but caught only the jeweled chain at her waist. He let go quickly, and, 
looking back, she saw that the pronged setting on one of the gems had cut him. 


reached out, but caught only the jeweled chain at her waist. He let go quickly, and, 
looking back, she saw that the pronged setting on one of the gems had cut him. 


Oh, wouldn't I? Elena told him with her own eyes. Boldly, she took his hand and 
held it a moment, teasing him. Then she brought the finger to her lips. 


After a few moments, she released it and looked up at him. "I do like dancing," 
she said, and found that, like him, she could speak with her mind. It was a thrilling 
sensation. She moved to the center of the room and waited. 


Page 58 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
He followed her, graceful as a stalking beast. His fingers were warm and hard 
when they clasped hers. 

There was music, although it faded in and out and sounded far away. Damon 
placed his other hand on her waist. She could feel the warmth of his fingers there, 
the pressure. She picked up her skirts, and they began dancing. 

It was lovely, like flying, and her body knew every move to make. They danced 
around and around that empty room, in perfect timing, together. 

He was laughing down at her, his dark eyes glittering with enjoyment. She felt so 
beautiful; so poised and alert and ready for anything. She couldn't remember when 
she'd had this much fun. 

Gradually, though, his smile faded, and their dancing slowed. At last she stood 
unmoving in the circle of his arms. His dark eyes were not amused any longer, but 
fierce and heated. She looked up at him soberly, unafraid. And then for the first time 
she felt as if she were dreaming; she felt slightly dizzy and very languid and weak. 

The room around her was blurring. She could see only his eyes, and they were 
making her feel more and more sleepy. She allowed her own eyes to half close, her 
head to fall back. She sighed. 

She could feel his gaze now, on her lips, on her throat. She smiled to herself and 
let her eyes close completely. 

He was supporting her weight now, keeping her from falling down. She felt his 
lips on the skin of her neck, burning hot as if he had a fever. Then she felt the sting, 
like the jabs of two needles. It was over quickly, though, and she relaxed to the 
pleasure of having her blood drawn out. 

She remembered this feeling, the feeling of floating on a bed of golden light. A 
delicious languor stole through all her limbs. She felt drowsy, as if it were too much 
trouble to move. She didn't want to move anyway; she felt too good. 

Her fingers were resting on his hair, clasping his head to her. Idly, she threaded 
them through the soft dark strands. His hair was like silk, warm and alive under her 
fingers. When she opened her eyes a slit, she saw that it reflected rainbows in the 
candlelight. Red and blue and purple, just like-just like the feathers... 


And then everything shattered. There was pain at her throat suddenly, as if her 
soul was being torn out of her. She was pushing at Damon, clawing at him, trying to 
force him away. Screams rang in her ears. Damon was fighting her, but it wasn't 
Damon; it was a crow. Huge wings beat against her, thrashing in the air.

Page 59 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
Elena struck out at it, one hand flung up to protect her eyes. She was still 
screaming. She couldn't get away from it, those terrible wings kept flailing frantically, 
with a sound like a thousand decks of cards being shuffled at once. 


The door burst open, and she heard shouts. The warm, heavy body of the crow 
struck her and her screams went higher. Then someone was pulling her off the bed, 
and she was standing protected behind Bonnie's father. He had a broom and he was 
beating at the bird with it. 


Bonnie was standing in the doorway. Elena ran into her arms. Bonnie's father was 
shouting, and then came the slam of a window. 


"It's out," Mr. McCullough said, breathing hard. 


Mary and Mrs. McCullough were just outside in the hallway, clad in bathrobes. 
"You're hurt," Mrs. McCullough said to Elena in amazement. "The nasty thing's 
pecked you." 


"I'm okay," Elena said, brushing at a spot of blood on her face. She was so 
shaken that her knees were about to give out. 


"How did it get in?" said Bonnie. 


Mr. McCullough was inspecting the window. "You shouldn't have left this open," 
he said. "And what did you want to take the locks off for?" 


"I didn't," Elena cried. 


"It was unlocked and open when I heard you screaming and came in," Bonnie's 
father said. "I don't know who else could have opened it but you." 


Elena choked back her protests. Hesitantly, cautiously, she moved to the window. 
He was right; the locks had been unscrewed. And it could have been done only from 
the inside. 


"Maybe you were sleepwalking," said Bonnie, leading Elena away from the 
window as Mr. McCullough began putting the locks back on. "We'd better get you 
cleaned up." 


Sleepwalking. Suddenly the entire dream flooded back to Elena. The hall of 
mirrors, and the ballroom, and Damon. Dancing with Damon. She pulled out of 
Bonnie's grasp. 


"I'll do it myself," she said, hearing her own voice quaver on the edge of hysteria. 
"No-really-I want to." She escaped into the bathroom and stood with her back to 


. 
the locked door, trying to breathe. 


the locked door, trying to breathe. 


Page 60 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
Her image stared back, ghastly pale, with eyes that looked bruised and frightened. 
There were deep shadows under them and smears of blood on her face. 

Slowly, she turned her head slightly and lifted up her hair. She almost cried out 
loud when she saw what was underneath. 

Two little wounds, fresh and open on the skin of her neck. 


Nine 

"I know I'm going to be sorry I asked this," Matt said, turning red-rimmed eyes 
from their contemplation of I-95 to Stefan in the passenger seat beside him. "But can 
you tell me why we want these extra-special, not-available-locally, semi-tropical 
weeds for Elena?" 

Stefan looked into the back seat at the results of their search through hedgerows 
and rough grass. The plants, with their branching green stems and their small-toothed 
leaves, did look more like weeds than anything else. The dried remains of blossoms 
at the ends of the shoots were almost invisible, and no one could pretend the shoots 
themselves were decorative. 

"What if I said they could be used to make an all-natural eyewash?" he offered, 
after a moment's thought. "Or an herbal tea?" 

"Why? Were you thinking of saying something like that?" 

"Not really." 

"Good. Because if you did I'd probably deck you." 

Without actually looking at Matt, Stefan smiled. There was something new stirring 
inside him, something he hadn't felt for nearly five centuries, except with Elena. 
Acceptance. Warmth and friendship shared with a fellow being, who did not know 
the truth about him, but who trusted him anyway. Who was willing to take him on 
faith. He wasn't sure he deserved it, but he couldn't deny what it meant to him. It 
almost made him feel... human again. 

Elena stared at her image in the mirror. It hadn't been a dream. Not entirely. The 
wounds in her neck proved that. And now that she'd seen them, she noticed the 
feeling of light-headedness, of lethargy. 

It was her own fault. She'd taken so much trouble to warn Bonnie and Meredith 
not to invite any strangers into their houses. And all the time she'd forgotten that she 
herself had invited Damon into Bonnie's house. She'd done it that night she had set 
up the dumb supper in Bonnie's dining room and called out into the darkness, 
"Come in." 

And the invitation was good forever. He could return any time he liked, even now. 

Page 61 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
Especially now, while she was weak and might easily be hypnotized into unlocking a 
window again. 


Elena stumbled out of the bathroom, past Bonnie, and into the guest bedroom. 
She grabbed her tote bag and began stuffing things into it. 


"Elena, you can't go home!" 


"I can't stay here," Elena said. She looked around for her shoes, spotted them by 
the bed, and started forward. Then she stopped, with a strangled sound. Lying on

the dainty crumpled linen of the bed there was a single black feather. It was huge, 
horribly huge and real and solid, with a thick, waxy-looking shaft. It looked almost 
obscene resting there on the white percale sheets. 


the dainty crumpled linen of the bed there was a single black feather. It was huge,

obscene resting there on the white percale sheets. 


"Okay, okay," Bonnie said. "If you feel that way about it, I'll get Dad to take you 
home." 


"You have to come, too." It had just dawned on Elena that Bonnie was no safer in 
this house than she was. You and your loved ones, she remembered, and turned to 
grasp Bonnie's arm. "You have to, Bonnie. I need you with me." 


And at last she got her way. The McCulloughs thought she was hysterical, that 
she was overreacting, possibly that she was having a nervous breakdown. But finally 
they gave in. Mr. McCullough drove her and Bonnie to the Gilbert house, where, 
feeling like burglars, they unlocked the door and crept inside without waking anyone 
up. 


Even here, Elena couldn't sleep. She lay beside Bonnie's softly breathing form, 
staring toward her bedroom window, watching. Outside, the quince branches 
squeaked against the glass, but nothing else moved until dawn. 


That was when she heard the car. She'd know the wheezing sound of Matt's 
engine anywhere. Alarmed, she tiptoed to the window and looked out into the 
early-morning stillness of another gray day. Then she hurried downstairs and opened 
the front door. 


"Stefan!" She had never been so glad to see anyone in her life. She flung herself 
upon him before he could even shut the car door. 


He swayed backward with the force of her impact, and she could feel his 
surprise. She wasn't usually so demonstrative in public. 


"Hey," he said, returning the hug gently. "Me, too, but don't crush the flowers." 


"Flowers?" She pulled back to look at what he was carrying; then, she looked at 


Page 62 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
his face. Then at Matt, who was emerging from the other side of the car. Stefan's 
face was pale and drawn; Matt's was puffy with tiredness, with bloodshot eyes. 


"You'd better come inside," she said at last, bewildered. "You both look awful." 


"It's vervain," said Stefan, some time later. He and Elena were sitting at the 
kitchen table. Through the open doorway, Matt could be seen stretched out on the 
family room sofa, snoring gently. He'd flopped there after eating three bowls of 
cereal. Aunt Judith, Bonnie, and Margaret were still upstairs asleep, but Stefan kept 
his voice low just the same. "You remember what I told you about it?" he said. 


"You said it helps keep your mind clear even when someone is using Power to 
influence it." Elena was proud of how steady her voice was. 


"Right. And that's one of the things Damon might try. He can use the power of 
his mind even from a distance, and he can do it whether you're awake or asleep." 


Tears filled Elena's eyes, and she looked down to hide them, gazing at the long 


. 
slender stems with the dried remains of tiny lilac flowers at the very tips. "Asleep?" 
she said, afraid that this time her voice was not as steady. 


slender stems with the dried remains of tiny lilac flowers at the very tips. "Asleep?" 
she said, afraid that this time her voice was not as steady. 


Oh, Stefan, if you only knew, Elena thought. The gift had come one night too late. 
In spite of all her efforts, a tear fell, dripping onto the long green leaves. 


"Elena!" He sounded startled. "What is it? Tell me." 


He was trying to look into her face, but she bowed her head, pressing it into his 
shoulder. He put his arms around her, not trying to force her up again. "Tell me," he 
repeated softly. 


This was the moment. If she was ever going to tell him, it should be now. Her 
throat felt burned and swollen, and she wanted to let all the words inside pour out. 


But she couldn't. No matter what, I won't let them fight over me, she thought. 


"It's just that-I was worried about you," she managed. "I didn't know where 
you'd gone, or when you were coming back." 


"I should have told you. But that's all? There's nothing else upsetting you?" 


"That's all." Now she would have to swear Bonnie to secrecy about the crow. 
Why did one lie always lead to another? "What should we do with the vervain?" she 
asked, sitting back. 


"I'll show you tonight. Once I've extracted the oil from the seeds, you can rub it 
into your skin or add it to a bath. And you can make the dried leaves into a sachet 


Page 63 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
and carry it with you or put it under your pillow at night." 

"I'd better give them to Bonnie and Meredith, too. They'll need protection." 

He nodded. "For now-" He broke off a sprig and placed it in her hand. "-just 
take this to school with you. I'm going back to the boarding house to extract the oil." 
He paused a moment and then spoke. "Elena..." 


"Yes?" 


"If I thought it would do you any good, I'd leave. I wouldn't expose you to 
Damon. But I don't think he'd follow me if I went, not any more. I think he might 
stay-because of you." 


"Don't even think about leaving," she said fiercely, looking up at him. "Stefan, 
that's the one thing I couldn't stand. Promise you won't; promise me." 


"I won't leave you alone with him," Stefan said, which was not quite the same 
thing. But there was no point in pushing him further. 


Instead, she helped him wake up Matt, and saw them both off. Then, with a stem 
of dried vervain in her hand, she went upstairs to get ready for school. 


Bonnie yawned all the way through breakfast, and she didn't really wake up until 
they were outside, walking to school with a brisk breeze in their faces. It was going 
to be a cold day. 


. 
"I had a very weird dream last night," Bonnie said. 


"I had a very weird dream last night," Bonnie said. 


"What about?" she said, bracing herself. 


"About you. I saw you standing under a tree and the wind was blowing. For some 
reason, I was afraid of you, and I didn't want to go any closer. You looked... 
different. Very pale but almost glowing. And then a crow flew down from the tree, 
and you reached out and grabbed it in midair. You were so fast it was unbelievable. 
And then you looked over at me, with this expression. You were smiling, but it made 
me want to run. And then you twisted the crow's neck, and it was dead." 


Elena had listened to this with growing horror. Now she said, "That's a disgusting 
dream." 


"It is, isn't it?" said Bonnie composedly. "I wonder what it means? Crows are 
birds of ill omen in the legends. They can foretell a death." 


"It probably meant that you knew how upset I was, finding that crow in the 
room." 


"Yes," Bonnie said. "Except for one thing. I had this dream before you woke us 


Page 64 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
all up screaming." 

That day at lunchtime there was another piece of violet paper on the office bulletin 
board. This one, though, read simply: LOOK IN PERSONALS. 

"What personals?" said Bonnie. 

Meredith, walking up at that moment with a copy of the Wildcat Weekly, the 
school newspaper, provided the answer. "Have you seen this?" she said. 

It was in the personals section, completely anonymous, with neither salutation nor 
signature. I can't bear the thought of losing him. But he's so very unhappy about 
something, and if he won't tell me what it is, if he won't trust me that much, I don't 
see any hope for us. 

Reading it, Elena felt a burst of new energy through her tiredness. Oh, God, she 
hated whoever was doing this. She imagined shooting them, stabbing them, watching 
them fall. And then, vividly, she imagined something else. Yanking back a fistful of 
the thief's hair and sinking her teeth into an unprotected throat. It was a strange, 
unsettling vision, but for a moment it almost seemed real. 

She became aware that Bonnie and Meredith were looking at her. 

"Well?" she said, feeling slightly uncomfortable. 

"I could tell you weren't listening," sighed Bonnie. "I just said it still doesn't look 
like Da-like the killer's work to me. It doesn't seem like a murderer would be so 
petty." 

"Much as I hate to agree with her, she's right," Meredith said. "This smells like 


someone sneaky. Someone who has a grudge against you personally and who really 
wants to make you suffer." 

someone sneaky. Someone who has a grudge against you personally and who really 
wants to make you suffer." 

"And somebody who knew you kept a diary, assuming they stole it on purpose. 
Maybe they were in one of your classes that day you took it to school. Remember? 
When Mr. Tanner almost caught you," Bonnie added. 

"Ms. Halpern did catch me; she even read some of it aloud, a bit about Stefan. 
That was right after Stefan and I got together. Wait a minute, Bonnie. That night at 
your house when the diary was stolen, how long were you two out of the living 
room?" 

"Just a few minutes. Yangtze had stopped barking, and I went to the door to let 
him in, and..." Bonnie pressed her lips together and shrugged. 

"So the thief had to be familiar with your house," said Meredith swiftly, "or he or 

Page 65 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
she wouldn't have been able to get in, get the diary, and get out again before we saw 
them. All right, then, we're looking for someone sneaky and cruel, probably in one of 
your classes, Elena, and most likely familiar with Bonnie's house. Someone who has 
a personal grudge and will stoop to anything to get you... Oh, my God." 


The three of them stared at one another. 


"It has to be," whispered Bonnie. "It has to." 


"We're so stupid; we should have seen it right away," said Meredith. 


For Elena, it meant the sudden realization that all the anger she'd felt about this 
before was nothing to the anger she was capable of feeling. A candle flame to the 
sun. 


"Caroline," she said, and clenched her teeth so hard her jaw hurt. 


Caroline. Elena actually felt she could kill the green-eyed girl right now. And she 
might have rushed out to try if Bonnie and Meredith hadn't stopped her. 


"After school," said Meredith firmly, "when we can take her somewhere private. 
Just wait that long, Elena." 


But as they headed for the cafeteria, Elena noticed an auburn head disappearing 
down the art and music corridor. And she remembered something Stefan had said 
earlier this year, about Caroline taking him into the photography room at lunchtime. 
For privacy, Caroline had told him. 


"You two go on; I forgot something," she said as soon as Bonnie and Meredith 
both had food on their cafeteria trays. Then she pretended to be deaf as she walked 
rapidly out and backtracked to the art wing. 


All the rooms were dark, but the photography room's door was unlocked. 
Something made Elena turn the knob cautiously, and move quietly once she was 
inside, rather than marching in to start a confrontation as she'd planned. Was 


. 
Caroline in here? If so, what was she doing alone in the dark? 


Caroline in here? If so, what was she doing alone in the dark? 


Silently, stealthily, she made her way until she stood just outside the doorway, and 
the murmur of sound resolved itself into words. 


"But how can we be sure she'll be the one they pick?" That was Caroline. 


"My father's on the school board. They'll pick her, all right." And that was Tyler 
Smallwood. His father was a lawyer, and on every board there was. "Besides, who 
else would it be?" he continued. " 'The Spirit of Fell's Church' is supposed to be 
brainy as well as built." 


Page 66 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
"And I don't have brains, I suppose?" 


"Did I say that? Look, if you want to be the one to parade in a white dress on 
Founders' Day, fine. But if you want to see Stefan Salvatore run out of town on the 
evidence of his own girlfriend's diary..." 


"But why wait so long?" 


Tyler sounded impatient. "Because this way it'll ruin the celebration, too. The 
Fells' celebration. Why should they get the credit for founding this town? The 
Smallwoods were here first." 


"Oh, who cares about who founded the town? All I want is to see Elena 
humiliated in front of the entire school." 


"And Salvatore." The pure hatred and malice in Tyler's voice made Elena's flesh 
crawl. "He'll be lucky if he doesn't end up hanging from a tree. You're sure the 
evidence is there?" 


"How many times do I have to tell you? First, it says she lost the ribbon on 
September second in the cemetery. Then, it says Stefan picked it up that day and 
kept it. Wickery Bridge is right beside the cemetery. That means Stefan was near the 
bridge on September second, the night the old man was attacked there. Everybody 
already knows he was on hand for the attacks on Vickie and Tanner. What more do 
you want?" 


"It would never stand up in court. Maybe I should get some corroborating 
evidence. Like ask old Mrs. Flowers what time he got home that night." 


"Oh, who cares? Most people think he's guilty already. The diary talks about 
some big secret he's hiding from everyone. People will get the idea." 


"You're keeping it in a safe place?" 


"No, Tyler, I'm keeping it out on the coffee table. How stupid do you think I 
am?" 


"Stupid enough to send Elena notes tipping her off." There was a crackle, as of 
newspaper. "Look at this, this is unbelievable. And it's got to stop, now. What if she 


. 
figures out who's doing it?" 


figures out who's doing it?" 


"I still want you to lay off. Just wait until Founders' Day; then you'll get to watch 
the Ice Princess melt." 


"And to say ciao to Stefan. Tyler... nobody's really going to hurt him, are they?" 


"Who cares?" Tyler mocked her earlier tone. "You leave that to me and my 


Page 67 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
friends, Caroline. You just do your part, okay?" 

Caroline's voice dropped to a throaty murmur. "Convince me." After a pause 
Tyler chuckled. 

There was movement, rustling sounds, a sigh. Elena turned and slipped out of the 
room as quietly as she had come in. 

She got into the next hallway, and then she leaned against the lockers there, trying 
to think. 

It was almost too much to absorb at once. Caroline, who had once been her best 
friend, had betrayed her and wanted to see her humiliated in front of the whole 
school. Tyler, who'd always seemed more an annoying jerk than a real threat, was 
planning to get Stefan driven out of town-or killed. And the worst thing was that 
they were using Elena's own diary to do it. 

Now she understood the beginning of her dream last night. She'd had a dream like 
it the day before she had discovered that Stefan was missing. In both, Stefan had 
looked at her with angry, accusing eyes, and then he had thrown a book at her feet 
and walked away. 

Not a book. Her diary. Which had in it evidence that could be deadly to Stefan. 
Three times people in Fell's Church had been attacked, and three times Stefan had 
been on the scene. What would that look like to the town, to the police? 

And there was no way to tell the truth. Supposing she said, "Stefan isn't guilty. 
It's his brother Damon who hates him and who knows how much Stefan hates even 
the thought of hurting and killing. And who followed Stefan around and attacked 
people to make Stefan think maybe Stefan had done it, to drive him mad. And who's 
here in town somewhere-look for him in the cemetery or in the woods. But, oh, by 
the way, don't just search for a good-looking guy, because he might be a crow at the 
moment. 

"Incidentally, he's a vampire." 

She didn't even believe it herself. It sounded ludicrous. 

A twinge from the side of her neck reminded her how serious the ludicrous story 
really was. She felt odd today, almost as if she were sick. It was more than just 
tension and lack of sleep. She felt slightly dizzy, and at times the ground seemed to 
be spongy, giving way under her feet and then springing back. 

Flu symptoms, except that she was sure they weren't due to any virus in her 
bloodstream. 


Damon's fault, again. Everything was Damon's fault, except the diary. She had no 
one to blame for that but herself. If only she hadn't written about Stefan, if only she 
hadn't brought the diary to school. If only she hadn't left it in Bonnie's living room. If 
only, if only. 

Page 68 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
Damon's fault, again. Everything was Damon's fault, except the diary. She had no 
one to blame for that but herself. If only she hadn't written about Stefan, if only she 
hadn't brought the diary to school. If only she hadn't left it in Bonnie's living room. If 
only, if only. 


Ten 

The bell rang. There was no time to go back to the cafeteria and tell Bonnie and 
Meredith. Elena set off for her next class, past the averted faces and hostile eyes that 
were becoming all too familiar these days. 

It was hard, in history class, not to stare at Caroline, not to let Caroline know she 
knew. Alaric asked about Matt and Stefan being absent for the second day in a row, 
and Elena shrugged, feeling exposed and on display. She didn't trust this man with 
the boyish smile and the hazel eyes and the thirst for knowledge about Mr. Tanner's 
death. And Bonnie, who simply gazed at Alaric soulfully, was no help at all. 

After class she caught a scrap of Sue Carson's conversation. "... he's on vacation 
from college-I forget exactly where..." 

Elena had had enough of discreet silence. She spun around and spoke directly to 
Sue and the girl Sue was talking to, bursting uninvited into their discussion. 

"If I were you," she said to Sue, "I would keep away from Damon. I mean that." 

There was startled, embarrassed laughter. Sue was one of the few people at 
school who hadn't shunned Elena, and now she was looking as if she wished she 
had. 

"You mean," said the other girl hesitantly, "because he's yours, too? Or-" 

Elena's own laughter was harsh. "I mean because he's dangerous," she said. 
"And I'm not joking." 

They just looked at her. Elena saved them the further embarrassment of having to 
reply or to get tactfully away by turning on her heel and leaving. She collected 
Bonnie from Alaric's cluster of after-school groupies and headed for Meredith's 
locker. 

"Where are we going? I thought we were going to talk to Caroline." 

"Not anymore," Elena said. "Wait until we get home. Then I'll tell you why." 

"I can't believe it," said Bonnie an hour later. "I mean, I believe it, but I can't 
believe it. Not even of Caroline." 

"It's Tyler," Elena said. "He's the one with the big plans. So much for men not 
being interested in diaries." 

Page 69 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
"Actually, we should thank him," said Meredith. "Because of him at least we have 
until Founders' Day to do something about it. Why did you say it was supposed to 
be on Founders' Day, Elena?" 

"Tyler has something against the Fells." 

"But they're all dead," said Bonnie. 

"Well, that doesn't seem to matter to Tyler. I remember him talking about it in the 


graveyard, too, when we were looking at their tomb. He thinks they stole his 
ancestors' rightful place as the town's founders or something." 

graveyard, too, when we were looking at their tomb. He thinks they stole his 
ancestors' rightful place as the town's founders or something." 

"Isn't that enough?" With those steady, dark eyes on her, Elena felt discomfort 
flutter between her ribs. What was Meredith asking? 

"Enough to get Stefan run out of town like they said," agreed Bonnie. 

"Enough that we have to get the diary back from Caroline," Elena said. "The only 
question is, how?" 

"Caroline said she had it hidden somewhere safe. That probably means her 
house." Meredith chewed her lip thoughtfully. "She's got just the one brother in 
eighth grade, right? And her mom doesn't work, but she goes shopping in Roanoke 
a lot. Do they still have a maid?" 

"Why?" said Bonnie. "What difference does it make?" 

"Well, we don't want anybody walking in while we're burglarizing the house." 

"While we're what?" Bonnie's voice rose to a squeak. "You can't be serious!" 

"What are we supposed to do, just sit back and wait until Founders' Day, and let 
her read Elena's diary in front of the town? She stole it from your house. We've just 
got to steal it back," Meredith said, maddeningly calm. 

"We'll get caught. We'll get expelled from school-if we don't end up going to 
jail." Bonnie turned to Elena in appeal. "Tell her, Elena." 

"Well..." In all honesty, the prospect made Elena herself a little queasy. It wasn't 
so much the idea of expulsion, or even jail, as just the thought of being caught in the 
act. Mrs. Forbes's haughty face floated before her eyes, full of righteous indignation. 
Then it changed to Caroline's, laughing spitefully as her mother pointed an accusing 
finger right at Elena. 

Besides, it seemed such a... a violation, to go into someone's house when they 

Page 70 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
were not there, to search their possessions. She would hate it if someone did that to 
her. 

But, of course, someone had. Caroline had violated Bonnie's house, and right 
now had Elena's most private possession in her hands. 

"Let's do it," Elena said quietly. "But let's be careful." 

"Can't we talk about this?" said Bonnie weakly, looking from Meredith's 
determined face to Elena's. 

"There's nothing to talk about. You're coming," Meredith told her. "You 
promised," she added, as Bonnie took a breath to object afresh. And she held up her 
index finger. 

"The blood oath was only to help Elena get Stefan!" Bonnie cried. 

"Think again," said Meredith. "You swore you would do whatever Elena asked in 


relation to Stefan. There wasn't anything about a time limit or about 'only until Elena 
gets him.' " 

relation to Stefan. There wasn't anything about a time limit or about 'only until Elena 
gets him.' " 

Bonnie shut her mouth and thrust her chin out. "Right," she said grimly. "Now I'm 
stuck for the rest of my life doing whatever Elena wants me to do about Stefan. 
Wonderful." 

"This is the last thing I'll ever ask," Elena said. "And I promise that. I swear-" 

"Don't!" said Meredith, suddenly serious. "Don't, Elena. You might be sorry 
later." 

"Now you're taking up prophecy, too?" Elena said. And then she asked, "So how 
are we going to get hold of Caroline's house key for an hour or so?" 

November 9, Saturday Dear Diary, 

I'm sorry it's been so long. Lately I've been too busy or too depressed-or both 
-to write you. 

Besides, with everything that's happened I'm almost afraid to keep a diary at all 
anymore. But I need someone to turn to, because right now there's not a single 
human being, not a single person on earth, that I'm not keeping something from. 

Bonnie and Meredith can't know the truth about Stefan. Stefan can't know the 
truth about Damon. Aunt Judith can't know about anything. Bonnie and Meredith 
know about Caroline and the diary; Stefan doesn't. Stefan knows about the 
vervain I use every day now, Bonnie and Meredith don't. Even though I've given 

Page 71 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
both of them sachets full of the stuff. One good thing: it seems to work, or at least I 
haven't been sleepwalking again since that night. But it would be a lie to say I 
haven't been dreaming about Damon. He's in all my nightmares. 


My life is full of lies right now, and I need someone to be completely honest 
with. I'm going to hide this diary under the loose floorboard in the closet, so that 
no one will find it even if I drop dead and they clean out my room. Maybe one of 
Margaret's grandchildren will be playing in there someday, and will pry up the 
board and pull it out, but until then, nobody. This diary is my last secret. 


I don't know why I'm thinking about death and dying. That's Bonnie's craze; 
she's the one who thinks it would be so romantic. I know what it's really like; there 
was nothing romantic about it when Mom and Dad died. Just the worst feelings in 
the world. I want to live for a good long time, marry Stefan, and be happy. And 
there's no reason why I can't, once all these problems are behind us. 


Except that there are times when I get scared and I don't believe that. And there 
are little things that shouldn't matter, but they bother me. Like why Stefan still 
wears Catherine's ring around his neck, even though I know he loves me. Like why 


. 
he's never said he loves me, even though I know it's true. 


he's never said he loves me, even though I know it's true. 


Elena stopped writing, trying to keep the letters on the page in focus. But they 
only blurred further, and she shut the book before a betraying teardrop could fall on 
the ink. Then she went over to the closet, pried up the loose board with a nail file, 
and put the diary there. 


She had the nail file in her pocket a week later as the three of them, she and 
Bonnie and Meredith, stood outside Caroline's back door. 


"Hurry up," hissed Bonnie in agony, looking around the yard as if she expected 
something to jump out at them. "Come on, Meredith!" 


"There," said Meredith, as the key finally went the right way into the dead bolt 
lock and the doorknob yielded to her turning fingers. "We're in." 


"Are you sure they're not in? Elena, what if they come back early? Why couldn't 
we do this in the daytime, at least?" 


"Bonnie, will you get inside? We've been through all this. The maid's always here 
in the daytime. And they won't be back early tonight unless somebody gets sick at 
Chez Louis. Now, come on!" said Elena. 


"Nobody would dare to get sick at Mr. Forbes's birthday dinner," Meredith said 
comfortingly to Bonnie as the smaller girl stepped in. "We're safe." 


"If they've got enough money to go to expensive restaurants, you'd think they 
could afford to leave a few lights on," said Bonnie, refusing to be comforted. 


Page 72 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
Privately, Elena agreed with this. It was strange and disconcerting to be wandering 
through someone else's house in the dark, and her heart pounded chokingly as they 
went up the stairs. Her palm, clutching the key chain flashlight that showed the way, 
was wet and slippery. But in spite of these physical symptoms of panic, her mind 
was still operating coolly, almost with detachment. 

"It's got to be in her bedroom," she said. 

Caroline's window faced the street, which meant they had to be even more careful 
not to show a light there. Elena swung the tiny beam of the flashlight around with a 
feeling of dismay. It was one thing to plan to search someone's room, to picture 
efficiently and methodically going through drawers. It was another thing actually to 
be standing here, surrounded by what seemed like thousands of places to hide 
something, and feeling afraid to touch anything in case Caroline noticed it had been 
disturbed. 

The other two girls were also standing still. 

"Maybe we should just go home," Bonnie said quietly. And Meredith did not 
contradict her. 


"We have to try. At least try," said Elena, hearing how tinny and hollow her voice 
sounded. She eased open a drawer on the highboy and shone the light onto dainty 
piles of lacy underwear. A moment's poking through them assured her there was 
nothing like a book there. She straightened the piles and shut the drawer again. Then 
she let out her breath.

piles of lacy underwear. A moment's poking through them assured her there was 
nothing like a book there. She straightened the piles and shut the drawer again. Then 
she let out her breath. 

She assigned herself the closet, and the first thing she did was prod at the 
floorboards with her nail file. But Caroline's boards all seemed to be secure and the 
walls of the closet sounded solid. Rummaging through Caroline's clothes she found 
several things she'd lent the other girl last year. She was tempted to take them back, 
but of course she couldn't. A search of Caroline's shoes and purses revealed 
nothing, even when she dragged a chair over so that she could investigate the top 
shelf of the closet thoroughly. 

Meredith was sitting on the floor examining a pile of stuffed animals that had been 
relegated to a chest with other childish mementos. She ran her long sensitive fingers 
over each, checking for slits in the material. When she reached a fluffy poodle, she 
paused. 

"I gave this to her," she whispered. "I think for her tenth birthday. I thought she'd 
thrown it away." 

Page 73 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
Elena couldn't see her eyes; Meredith's own flashlight was turned on the poodle. 
But she knew how Meredith was feeling. 


"I tried to make up with her," she said softly. "I did, Meredith, at the Haunted 
House. But she as good as told me she would never forgive me for taking Stefan 
from her. I wish things could be different, but she won't let them be." 


"So now it's war." 


"So now it's war," said Elena, flat and final. She watched as Meredith put the 
poodle aside and picked up the next animal. Then she turned back to her own 
search. 


But she had no better luck with the dresser than she had with the closet. And with 
every moment that passed she felt more uneasy, more certain that they were about to 
hear a car pulling into the Forbes' driveway. 


"It's no use," Meredith said at last, feeling underneath Caroline's mattress. "She 
must have hidden it... wait. There's something here. I can feel a corner." 


Elena and Bonnie stared from opposite ends of the room, momentarily frozen. 


"I've got it. Elena, it's a diary!" 


Relief swooped through Elena then, and she felt like a crumpled piece of paper 
being straightened and smoothed. She could move again. Breathing was wonderful. 
She'd known, she'd known all along that nothing really terrible could happen to 


. 
Stefan. Life couldn't be that cruel, not to Elena Gilbert. They were all safe now. 


Stefan. Life couldn't be that cruel, not to Elena Gilbert. They were all safe now. 


"What?" Elena snatched the little book, shining her light on it, trying to make the 
emerald green of the cover change into sapphire blue. It didn't work. This diary was 
almost exactly like hers, but it wasn't hers. 


"It's Caroline's," she said stupidly, still not wanting to believe it. 


Bonnie and Meredith crowded close. They all looked at the closed book, and 
then at one another. 


"There might be clues," said Elena slowly. 


"It's only fair," agreed Meredith. But it was Bonnie who actually took the diary 
and opened it. 


Elena peered over her shoulder at Caroline's spiky back-slanted writing, so 
different from the block letters of the purple notes. At first her eyes wouldn't focus, 
but then a name leapt out at her. Elena. 


Page 74 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
"Wait, what's that?" 

Bonnie, who was the only one actually in a position to read more than one or two 
words, was silent a moment, her lips moving. Then she snorted. 

"Listen to this," she said, and read: " 'Elena's the most selfish person I've ever 
known. Everyone thinks she's so together, but it's really just coldness. It's sickening 
the way people suck up to her, never realizing that she doesn't give a damn about 
anyone or anything except Elena.' " 

"Caroline says that? She should talk!" But Elena could feel heat in her face. It 
was, practically, what Matt had said about her when she was after Stefan. 

"Go on, there's more," said Meredith, poking at Bonnie, who continued in an 
offended voice. 

" 'Bonnie's almost as bad these days, always trying to make herself important. 
The newest thing is pretending she's psychic so people will pay attention to her. If 
she was really psychic she'd figure out that Elena is just using her. 

There was a heavy pause, and then Elena said, "Is that all?" 

"No, there's a bit about Meredith. 'Meredith doesn't do anything to stop it. In fact, 
Meredith doesn't do anything; she just watches. It's as if she can't act; she can only 
react to things. Besides, I've heard my parents talking about her family-no wonder 
she never mentions them.' What's that supposed to mean?" 

Meredith hadn't moved, and Elena could see only her neck and chin in the dim 
light. But she spoke quietly and steadily. "It doesn't matter. Keep on looking, 
Bonnie, for something about Elena's diary." 

"Try around October eighteenth. That was when it was stolen," said Elena, 
putting her questions aside. She'd ask Meredith about it later. 


There was no entry for October eighteenth or the weekend after; in fact, there 
were only a few entries for the following weeks. None of them mentioned the diary. 

There was no entry for October eighteenth or the weekend after; in fact, there 
were only a few entries for the following weeks. None of them mentioned the diary. 

It was a tempting idea, but Bonnie spotted the flaw. "There's nothing bad about 
Caroline in here; it's all just complaints about other people. Mostly us. I'll bet 
Caroline would love to have it read out loud in front of the whole school. It'd make 
her day." 

"So what do we do with it?" 

"Put it back," said Elena tiredly. She swung her light around the room, which 
seemed to her eyes to be filled with subtle differences from when they'd come in. 
"We'll just have to keep on pretending we don't know she has my diary, and hope 

Page 75 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
for another chance." 


"All right," said Bonnie, but she went on thumbing through the little book, 
occasionally giving vent to an indignant snort or hiss. "Will you listen to this!" she 
exclaimed. 


"There isn't time," Elena said. She would have said something else, but at that 
moment Meredith spoke, her tone commanding everyone's immediate attention. 


"A car." 


It took only a second to ascertain that the vehicle was pulling up into the Forbes' 
driveway. Bonnie's eyes and mouth were wide and round and she seemed to be 
paralyzed, kneeling by the bed. 


"Go! Go on," said Elena, snatching the di-ary from her. "Turn the flashlights off 
and get out the back door." 


They were already moving, Meredith urging Bonnie forward. Elena dropped to 
her knees and lifted the bedspread, pulling up at Caroline's mattress. With her other 
hand she pushed the diary forward, wedging it between the mattress and the dust 
ruffle. The thinly covered box springs bit into her arm from below, but even worse 
was the weight of the queen-size mattress bearing down from above. She gave the 
book a few more nudges with her fingertips and then pulled her arm out, tugging the 
bedspread back in place. 


She gave one wild glance back at the room as she left; there was no time to fix 
anything more now. As she moved swiftly and silently toward the stairs, she heard a 
key in the front door. 


What followed was a sort of dreadful game of tag. Elena knew they were not 
deliberately chasing her, but the Forbes family seemed determined to corner her in 
their house. She turned back the way she had come as voices and lights materialized 
in the hall as they headed up the stairs. She fled from them into the last doorway 
down the hall, and they seemed to follow. They moved across the landing; they were 
right outside the master bedroom. She turned toward the adjoining bathroom, but

then saw lights spring to life under the closed door, cutting off her escape. 


then saw lights spring to life under the closed door, cutting off her escape. 


Outside, the air was cool, and her panting breath showed faintly. Yellow light 
burst forth from the room beside her, and she huddled even farther to the left, 
keeping out of its path. Then, the sound she had been dreading came with terrible 
clarity: the snick of a door handle, followed by a billowing of curtains inward as the 
french windows opened. 


She looked around frantically. It was too far to jump to the ground, and there was 
nothing to grab hold of to climb down. That left only the roof, but there was nothing 
to climb up, either. Still, some instinct made her try, and she was on the balcony 


Page 76 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
railing and groping for a handhold above even as a shadow appeared on the filmy 
curtains. A hand parted them, a figure began to emerge, and then Elena felt 
something clasping her own hand, locking on her wrist and hauling her upwards. 
Automatically, she boosted with her feet and felt herself scrambling onto the shingled 
roof. Trying to calm her ragged breath, she looked over gratefully to see who her 
rescuer was-and froze. 


Eleven 

"The name is Salvatore. As in savior," he said. There was a brief flash of white 
teeth in the darkness. 

Elena looked down. The overhang of the roof obscured the balcony, but she 
could hear shuffling sounds down there. But they were not the sounds of pursuit, 
and there was no sign that her companion's words had been overheard. A minute 
later, she heard the french windows close. 

"I thought it was Smith," she said, still looking down into the darkness. 

Damon laughed. It was a terribly engaging laugh, without the bitter edge of 
Stefan's. It made her think of the rainbow lights on the crow's feathers. 

Nevertheless, she was not fooled. Charming as he seemed, Damon was 
dangerous almost beyond imagination. That graceful, lounging body was ten times 
stronger than a human's. Those lazy dark eyes were adapted to seeing perfectly at 
night. The long-fingered hand that had pulled her up to the roof could move with 
impossible quickness. And, most disturbing of all, his mind was the mind of a killer. 
A predator. 

She could feel it just beneath his surface. He was different from a human. He had 
lived so long by hunting and killing that he'd forgotten any other way. And he 
enjoyed it, not fighting his nature as Stefan did, but glorying in it. He had no morals 
and no conscience, and she was trapped here with him in the middle of the night. 

She settled back on one heel, ready to jump into action at any minute. She ought 
to be angry with him now, after what he'd done to her in the dream. She was, but 
there was no point in expressing it. He knew how furious she must be, and he would 
only laugh at her if she told him. 

She watched him quietly, intently, waiting for his next move. 

But he didn't move. Those hands that could dart as quickly as striking snakes 
rested motionlessly on his knees. His expression reminded her of the way he'd 
looked at her once before. The first time they'd met she'd seen the same guarded, 
reluctant respect in his eyes-except that then there had also been surprise in them. 
Now there was none. 

"You're not going to scream at me? Or faint?" he said, as if offering her the 
standard options. 

Page 77

Elena was still watching him. He was much stronger than she was, and faster, but 
if she needed to she thought she could get to the edge of the roof before he reached 
her. It was a thirty foot drop if she missed the balcony, but she might decide to risk 
it. It all depended on Damon. 


"I don't faint," she said shortly. "And why should I scream at you? We were 
playing a game. I was stupid that night and so I lost. You warned me in the 
graveyard about the consequences." 


. 
His lips parted in a quick breath and he looked away. "I may just have to make 
you my Queen of Shadows," he said, and, speaking almost to himself, he continued: 
"I've had many companions, girls as young as you and women who were the 
beauties of Europe. But you're the one I want at my side. Ruling, taking what we 
want when we want it. Feared and worshipped by all the weaker souls. Would that 
be so bad?"

you my Queen of Shadows," he said, and, speaking almost to himself, he continued:

be so bad?" 


"Are you sure?" He looked at her, and she could feel the power of his mind as it 
touched hers, like the brush of those long fingers. But there was no dizziness, no 
feeling of weakness or succumbing. That afternoon she'd had a long soak, as she 
always did these days, in a hot bath sprinkled with dried vervain. 


Damon's eyes flashed with understanding, but he took the setback with good 
grace. "What are you doing here?" he said casually. 


It was strange, but she felt no need to lie to him. "Caroline took something that 
belonged to me. A diary. I came to get it back." 


A new look flickered in the dark eyes. "Undoubtedly to protect my worthless 
brother somehow," he said, annoyed. 


"Stefan isn't involved in this!" 


"Oh, isn't he?" She was afraid he understood more than she meant him to. 
"Strange, he always seems to be involved when there's trouble. He creates problems. 
Now, if he were out of the picture..." 


Elena spoke steadily. "If you hurt Stefan again I'll make you sorry. I'll find some 
way to make you wish you hadn't, Damon. I mean it." 


"I see. Well, then, I'll just have to work on you, won't I?" 


Elena said nothing. She'd talked herself into a corner, agreeing to play this deadly 


Page 78 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
game of his again. She looked away. 

"I'm going to have you in the end, you know," he said softly. It was the voice 
he'd used at the party, when he'd said, "Easy, easy." There was no mockery or 
malice now; he was simply stating a fact. "By hook or by crook, as you people say 
-that's a nice phrase -you'll be mine before the next snow flies." 

Elena tried to conceal the chill she felt, but she knew he saw anyway. 

"Good," he said. "You do have some sense. You're right to be afraid of me; I'm 
the most dangerous thing you're ever likely to encounter in your life. But just now I 
have a business proposition for you." 

"A business proposition?" 

"Exactly. You came here to get a diary. But you haven't got it." He indicated her 
empty hands. "You failed, didn't you?" When Elena made no reply he went on. 
"And since you don't want my brother involved, he can't help you. But I can. And I 
will." 


"You will?" 

"You will?" 

Elena stared at him. Blood flamed in her face. When she managed to get words 
out, they would come only in a whisper. 

"What-price?" 

A smile gleamed out of the darkness. "A few minutes of your time, Elena. A few 
drops of your blood. An hour or so spent with me, alone." 

"You..." Elena couldn't find the right word. Every epithet she knew was too mild. 

"I'll have it anyway, eventually," he said in a reasonable tone. "If you're honest, 
you'll admit that to yourself. Last time wasn't the last. Why not accept that?" His 
voice dropped to a warm, intimate timbre. "Remember..." 

"I'd rather cut my throat," she said. 

"An intriguing thought. But I can do it so much more enjoyably." 

He was laughing at her. Somehow, on top of everything else today, this was too 
much. "You're disgusting; you know that," she said. "You're sickening." She was 
shaking now, and she couldn't breathe. "I'd die before I'd give in to you. I'd rather-
" 

She wasn't sure what made her do it. When she was with Damon a sort of instinct 
took over her. And at that moment, she did feel that she'd rather risk anything than 
let him win this time. She noticed, with half her mind, that he was sitting back, 

Page 79 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
relaxed, enjoying the turn his game was taking. The other half of her mind was 
calculating how far the roof overhung the balcony. 

"I'd rather do this," she said, and flung herself sideways. 

She was right; he was off guard and couldn't move fast enough to stop her. She 
felt free space below her feet and spinning terror as she realized the balcony was 
farther back than she'd thought. She was going to miss it. 

But she hadn't reckoned on Damon. His hand shot out, not quick enough to keep 
her on the roof, but keeping her from falling any farther. It was as if her weight was 
nothing to him. Reflexively, Elena grasped the shingled edge of the roof and tried to 
get a knee up. 

His voice was furious. "You little fool! If you're that eager to meet death I can 
introduce you myself." 

"Let go of me," said Elena through her teeth. Someone was going to come out on 
that balcony at any second, she was sure of it. "Let go of me." 

"Here and now?" Looking into those unfathomable black eyes, she realized he 
was serious. If she said yes he would drop her. 

"It would be a fast way to end things, wouldn't it?" she said. Her heart was 
pounding in fear, but she refused to let him see that. 

"But such a waste." With one motion, he jerked her to safety. To himself. His 


arms tightened around her, pressing her to the lean hardness of his body, and 
suddenly Elena could see nothing. She was enveloped. Then she felt those flat 
muscles gathering themselves like some great cat's, and the two of them launched 
into space.

muscles gathering themselves like some great cat's, and the two of them launched 
into space. 

Stefan had done something similar once. But Stefan had not held her this way 
afterward, bruisingly close, with his lips almost in contact with hers. 

"Think about my proposition," he said. 

She could not move or look away. And this time she knew that it was no Power 
that he was using, but simply the wildfire attraction between them. It was useless to 
deny it; her body responded to his. She could feel his breath on her lips. 

"I don't need you for anything," she told him. 

She thought he was going to kiss her then, but he didn't. Above them there was 

Page 80 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
the sound of french windows opening and an angry voice on the balcony. "Hey! 
What's going on? Is somebody out there?" 

"This time I did you a favor," Damon said, very softly, still holding her. "Next 
time I'm going to collect." 

She couldn't have turned her head away. If he'd kissed her then, she would have 
let him. But suddenly the hardness of his arms melted around her and his face 
seemed to blur. It was as if the darkness was taking him back into itself. Then black 
wings caught and beat the air and a huge crow was soaring away. 

Something, a book or shoe, was hurled after it from the balcony. It missed by a 
yard. 

"Damn birds!" said Mr. Forbes's voice from above. "They must be nesting on the 
roof." 

Shivering, with her arms locked around her, Elena huddled in the darkness below 
until he went back inside. 

She found Meredith and Bonnie crouching by the gate. "What took you so long?" 
Bonnie whispered. "We thought you were caught!" 

"I almost was. I had to stay until it was safe." Elena was so used to lying about 
Damon that she did it now without conscious effort. "Let's go home," she 
whispered. "There's nothing more we can do." 

When they parted at Elena's door, Meredith said, "It's only two weeks until 
Founders' Day." 

"I know." For a moment Damon's proposition swam in Elena's mind. But she 
shook her head to clear it. "I'll think of something," she said. 

She hadn't thought of anything by the next day of school. The one encouraging 


fact was that Caroline didn't seem to have noticed anything amiss in her room-but 
that was all Elena could find to be encouraged about. There was an assembly that 
morning, at which it was announced that the school board had chosen Elena as the 
student to represent "The Spirit of Fell's Church." All through the principal's speech 
about it, Caroline's smile had blazed forth, triumphant and malicious.

That afternoon, waiting for the sixth-period history class to be let out, Elena 
studied Tyler Smallwood. Since coming back to school, he had not addressed one 
word to her directly. He'd smiled as nastily as Caroline during the principal's 

Page 81 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
announcement. Now, as he caught sight of Elena standing alone, he jostled Dick 
Carter with his elbow. 

"What's that there?" he said. "A wallflower?" 

Stefan, where are you? thought Elena. But she knew the answer to that. Halfway 
across school, in astronomy class. 

Dick opened his mouth to say something, but then his expression changed. He 
was looking beyond Elena, down the hall. Elena turned and saw Vickie. 

Vickie and Dick had been together before the Homecoming Dance. Elena 
supposed they still were. But Dick looked uncertain, as if he wasn't sure what to 
expect from the girl who was moving toward him. 

There was something odd about Vickie's face, about her walk. She was moving 
as if her feet didn't touch the floor. Her eyes were dilated and dreamy. 

"Hi there," Dick said tentatively, and he stepped in front of her. Vickie passed him 
without a glance and went on to Tyler. Elena watched what happened next with 
growing uneasiness. It should have been funny, but it wasn't. 

It started with Tyler looking somewhat taken aback. Then Vickie put a hand on 
his chest. Tyler smiled, but there was a forced look about it. Vickie slid her hand 
under his jacket. Tyler's smile wavered. Vickie put her other hand on his chest. Tyler 
looked at Dick. 

"Hey, Vickie, lighten up," said Dick hastily, but he didn't move any closer. 

Vickie slid her two hands upwards, pushing Tyler's jacket off his shoulders. He 
tried to shrug it back on without letting go of his books or seeming too concerned. 
He couldn't. Vickie's fingers crept under his shirt. 

"Stop that. Stop her, will you?" said Tyler to Dick. He had backed up into the 
wall. 

"Hey, Vickie, leggo. Don't do that." But Dick remained at a safe distance. Tyler 
shot him an enraged glare and tried to shove Vickie away. 

A noise had begun. At first it seemed to be at a frequency almost too low for 


human hearing, but it grew louder and louder. A growl, eerily menacing, that sent ice 
down Elena's spine. Tyler was looking pop-eyed with disbelief, and she soon 
realized why. The sound was coming from Vickie. 

human hearing, but it grew louder and louder. A growl, eerily menacing, that sent ice 
down Elena's spine. Tyler was looking pop-eyed with disbelief, and she soon 
realized why. The sound was coming from Vickie. 

"Don't hurt her! Be careful! It's epilepsy, we just need to get her lying down!" 

Page 82 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
Vickie's teeth snapped again as he reached a helpful hand into the melee. The 
slender girl was stronger than all of them together, and they were losing control of 
her. They weren't going to be able to hold her much longer. It was with intense relief 
that Elena heard a familiar voice at her shoulder. 

"Vickie, calm down. It's all right. Just relax now. 

With Stefan grasping Vickie's arm and talking to her soothingly, Elena dared to 
slacken her own grip. And it seemed, at first, that Stefan's strategy was working. 
Vickie's clawing fingers loosened, and they were able to lift her off Tyler. As Stefan 
kept speaking to her, she went limp and her eyes shut. 

"That's good. You're feeling tired now. It's all right to go to sleep." 

But then, abruptly, it stopped working, and whatever Power Stefan had been 
exercising over her was broken. Vickie's eyes flew open, and they bore no 
resemblance to the startled fawn's eyes Elena had seen in the cafeteria. They were 
blazing with red fury. She snarled at Stefan and burst out fighting with fresh strength. 

It took five or six of them to hold her down while somebody called the police. 
Elena stayed where she was, talking to Vickie, sometimes yelling at her, until the 
police got there. None of it did any good. 

Then she stepped back and saw the crowd of onlookers for the first time. Bonnie 
was in the front row, staring open-mouthed. So was Caroline. 

"What happened!" said Bonnie as the officials carried Vickie away. 

Elena, panting gently, pushed a strand of hair out of her eyes. "She went crazy 
and tried to undress Tyler." 

Bonnie pursed her lips. "Well, she'd have to be crazy to want to, wouldn't she?" 
And she threw a smirk over her shoulder directly at Caroline. 

Elena's knees were rubbery and her hands were shaking. She felt an arm go 
around her, and she leaned against Stefan gratefully. Then she looked up at him. 

"Epilepsy?" she said with disbelieving scorn. 

He was gazing down the hall after Vickie. Alaric Saltzman, still shouting 
instructions, was apparently going with her. The group turned the corner. 

"I think class was just dismissed," Stefan said. "Let's go." 


They walked toward the boarding house in silence, each lost in thought. Elena 
frowned, and several times glanced over at Stefan, but it wasn't until they were alone 
in his room that she spoke.

frowned, and several times glanced over at Stefan, but it wasn't until they were alone 
in his room that she spoke. 

"That's what I've been wondering. There's only one explanation I can think of, 
and it's that she's still under attack." 

"You mean Damon's still-oh, my God! Oh, Stefan, I should have given her 
some of the vervain. I should have realized..." 

"It wouldn't have made any difference. Believe me." She had turned toward the 
door as if to go after Vickie that minute, but he pulled her gently back. "Some 
people are more easily influenced than others, Elena. Vickie's will was never very 
strong. It belongs to him, now." 

Slowly, Elena sat down. "Then there's nothing anyone can do? But, Stefan, will 
she become-like you and Damon?" 

"It depends." His tone was bleak. "It's not just a matter of how much blood she 
loses. She needs his blood in her veins to make the change complete. Otherwise, 
she'll just end up like Mr. Tanner. Drained, used up. Dead." 

Elena took a long breath. There was something else she wanted to ask him about, 
something she'd wanted to ask him for a long time. "Stefan, when you spoke to 
Vickie back there, I thought it was working. You were using your Powers on her, 
weren't you?" 

"Yes." 

"But then she just went crazy again. What I mean is... Stefan, you are okay, 
aren't you? Your Powers have come back?" 

He didn't answer. But that was answer enough for her. "Stefan, why didn't you tell 
me? What's wrong?" She went around and knelt by him so that he had to look at her. 

"It's taking me a while to recover, that's all. Don't worry about it." 

"I am worried. Isn't there anything we can do?" 

"No," he said. But his eyes dropped. 

Comprehension swept through Elena. "Oh," she whispered, sitting back. Then 
she reached for him again, trying to get hold of his hands. "Stefan, listen to me-" 

"Elena, no. Don't you see? It's dangerous, dangerous for both of us, but 
especially for you. It could kill you, or worse." 

"Only if you lose control," she said. "And you won't. Kiss me." 

"No," said Stefan again. He added, less harshly, "I'll go out hunting tonight as 
soon as it's dark." 

Page 84 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
"Is that the same?" she said. She knew it wasn't. It was human blood that gave 
Power. "Oh, Stefan, please; don't you see I want to? Don't you want to?" 


"That isn't fair," he said, his eyes tortured. "You know it isn't, Elena. You know 
how much-" He turned away from her again, his hands clenched into fists. 

"That isn't fair," he said, his eyes tortured. "You know it isn't, Elena. You know 
how much-" He turned away from her again, his hands clenched into fists. 

Stefan was still turned away, and he shook his head. 

"All right," Elena whispered, but she felt a wash of grief and fear as defeat seeped 
into her bones. Most of the fear was for Stefan, who was vulnerable without his 
Powers, vulnerable enough that he might be hurt by the ordinary citizens of Fell's 
Church. But some of it was for herself. 


Twelve 

A voice spoke as Elena reached for a can on the store shelf. 

"Cranberry sauce already?" 

Elena looked up. "Hi, Matt. Yes, Aunt Judith likes to do a preview the Sunday 
before Thanksgiving, remember? If she practices, there's less chance she'll do 
something terrible." 

"Like forgetting to buy the cranberry sauce until fifteen minutes before dinner?" 

"Until five minutes before dinner," said Elena, consulting her watch, and Matt 
laughed. It was a good sound, and one Elena hadn't heard for too long. She moved 
on toward the check-out stand, but after she'd paid for her purchase she hesitated, 
looking back. 

Matt was standing by the magazine rack, apparently absorbed, but there was 
something about the slope of his shoulders that made her want to go to him. 

She poked a finger at his magazine. "What are you doing for dinner?" she said. 
When he glanced uncertainly toward the front of the store, she added, "Bonnie's 
waiting out in the car; she'll be there. Other than that it's just the family. And Robert, 
of course; he should be there by now." She meant that Stefan wasn't coming. She 
still wasn't sure how things were between Matt and Stefan these days. At least they 
spoke to each other. 

"I'm fending for myself tonight; Mom's not feeling so hot," he said. But then, as if 
to change the subject, he went on, "Where's Meredith?" 

"With her family, visiting some relatives or something." Elena was vague because 
Meredith had been vague herself; she seldom talked about her family. "So what do 

Page 85 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
you think? Want to take a chance on Aunt Judith's cooking?" 

"For old times' sake?" 

"For old friends' sake," said Elena after a moment's hesitation, and smiled at him. 

He blinked and looked away. "How can I refuse an invitation like that?" he said in 
an oddly muted voice. But when he put the magazine back and followed her out he 
was smiling, too. 


Bonnie greeted him cheerfully, and when they got home Aunt Judith looked 
pleased to see him come into the kitchen. 


"Dinner's almost ready," she said, taking the grocery bag from Elena. "Robert got 
here a few minutes ago. Why don't you go straight on back to the dining room? Oh, 
and get another chair, Elena. Matt makes seven." 


"Six, Aunt Judith," said Elena, amused. "You and Robert, me and Margaret, Matt 
and Bonnie." 


"Yes, dear, but Robert's brought a guest, too. They're already sitting down." 


. 
Elena registered the words just as she stepped through the dining room door, but 
there was an instant's delay before her mind reacted to them. Even so, she knew; 
stepping through that door, she somehow knew what was waiting for her. 


Elena registered the words just as she stepped through the dining room door, but 
there was an instant's delay before her mind reacted to them. Even so, she knew; 
stepping through that door, she somehow knew what was waiting for her. 


Elena realized she'd stopped moving when Bonnie ran into her from behind. Then 
she forced her legs into action. Her mind wasn't as obedient; it remained frozen. 


"Ah, Elena," Robert said, holding out a hand. "This is Elena, the girl I was telling 
you about," he said to Damon. "Elena, this is Damon... ah..." 


"Smith," said Damon. 


"Oh, yes. He's from my alma mater, William and Mary, and I just ran into him 
outside the drugstore. Since he was looking for some place to eat, I invited him 
along here for a home-cooked meal. Damon, these are some friends of Elena's, Matt 
and Bonnie." 


"Hi," said Matt. Bonnie just stared; then, she swung enormous eyes on Elena. 


Elena was trying to get a grip on herself. She didn't know whether to shriek, 
march out of the room, or throw the glass of wine Robert was pouring in Damon's 
face. She was too angry, for the moment, to be frightened. 


Matt went to bring in a chair from the living room. Elena wondered at his casual 


Page 86 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
acceptance of Damon, and then realized he hadn't been at Alaric's party. He wouldn't 
know what had happened there between Stefan and the "visitor from college." 

Bonnie, though, looked ready to panic. She was gazing at Elena imploringly. 
Damon had risen and was holding out a chair for her. 

Before Elena could come up with a response, she heard Margaret's high little 
voice in the doorway. "Matt, do you want to see my kitty? Aunt Judith says I can 
keep her. I'm going to call her Snowball." 

Elena turned, fired with an idea. 

"She's cute," Matt was saying obligingly, bending over the little mound of white 
fur in Margaret's arms. He looked startled as Elena unceremoniously grabbed the 
kitten from under his nose. 

"Here, Margaret, let's show your kitty to Robert's friend," she said, and thrust the 
fluffy bundle into Damon's face, all but throwing it at him. 

Pandemonium ensued. Snowball swelled to twice her normal size as her fur stood 
on end. She made a noise like water dropped on a red-hot griddle and then she was 
a snarling, spitting cyclone that clawed Elena, swiped at Damon, and ricocheted off 
the walls before tearing out of the room. 

For an instant, Elena had the satisfaction of seeing Damon's night black eyes 
slightly wider than usual. Then the lids drooped down, hooding them again, and 
Elena turned to face the reaction of the other occupants of the room. 


Margaret was just opening her mouth for a steam engine wail. Robert was trying 
to forestall it, hustling her off to find the cat. Bonnie had her back pressed flat 
against the wall, looking desperate. Matt and Aunt Judith, who was peering in from 
the kitchen, just looked appalled.

After a few minutes, Robert reappeared with a tear-stained Margaret and frowned 
sternly at Elena. Matt pushed his own chair in silently although his eyebrows were in 
his hair. 

As Aunt Judith arrived and the meal began, Elena looked up and down the table. 
A bright haze seemed to lie over everything, and she had a feeling of unreality, but 
the scene itself looked almost unbelievably wholesome, like something out of a 
commercial. Just your average family sitting down to eat turkey, she thought. One 
slightly flustered maiden aunt, worried that the peas will be mushy and the rolls 
burnt, one comfortable uncle-to-be, one golden-haired teenage niece and her 
tow-headed baby sister. One blue-eyed boy-next-door type, one spritely girlfriend, 
one gorgeous vampire passing the candied yams. A typical American household. 

Page 87 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
Bonnie spent the first half of the meal telegraphing "What do I do?" messages to 
Elena with her eyes. But when all Elena telegraphed back was "Nothing," she 
apparently decided to abandon herself to her fate. She began to eat. 


Elena had no idea what to do. To be trapped tike this was an insult, a humiliation, 
and Damon knew it. He had Aunt Judith and Robert dazzled, though, with 
compliments about the meal and light chat about William and Mary. Even Margaret 
was smiling at him now, and soon enough Bonnie would go under. 


"Fell's Church is having its Founders' Day celebration next week," Aunt Judith 
informed Damon, her thin cheeks faintly pink. "It would be so nice if you could 
come back for that." 


"I'd like to," said Damon affably. 


Aunt Judith looked pleased. "And this year Elena has a big part in it. She's been 
chosen to represent the Spirit of Fell's Church." 


"You must be proud of her," said Damon. 


"Oh, we are," Aunt Judith said. "So you'll try to come then?" 


Elena broke in, buttering a roll furiously. "I've heard some news about Vickie," 
she said. "You remember, the girl who was attacked." She looked pointedly at 
Damon. 


There was a short silence. Then Damon said, "I'm afraid I don't know her." 


"Oh, I'm sure you do. About my height, brown eyes, light brown hair... anyway, 
she's getting worse." 


. 
"Oh, dear," said Aunt Judith. 


"Oh, dear," said Aunt Judith. 


"No thank you. I'll have some more of this, though." He held a spoonful of jellied 
cranberry sauce up to one of the candles so that light shone through it. "It's such a 
tantalizing color." 


Bonnie, like the rest of the people at the table, looked up at the candle when he 
did this. But Elena noticed she didn't look down again. She remained gazing into the 
dancing flame, and slowly all expression disappeared from her face. 


Oh, no, thought Elena, as a tingle of apprehension crept through her limbs. She'd 
seen that look before. She tried to get Bonnie's attention, but the other girl seemed to 
see nothing but the candle. 


"... and then the elementary children put on a pageant about the town's history," 
Aunt Judith was saying to Damon. "But the ending ceremony is done by older 


Page 88 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
students. Elena, how many seniors will be doing the readings this year?" 

"Just three of us." Elena had to turn to address her aunt, and it was while she was 
looking at Aunt Judith's smiling face that she heard the voice. 

"Death." 

Aunt Judith gasped. Robert paused with his fork halfway to his mouth. Elena 
wished, wildly and absolutely hopelessly, for Meredith. 

"Death," said the voice again. "Death is in this house." 

Elena looked around the table and saw that there was no one to help her. They 
were all staring at Bonnie, motionless as subjects in a photograph. 

Bonnie herself was staring into the candle flame. Her face was blank, her eyes 
wide, as they had been before when this voice spoke through her. Now, those 
sightless eyes turned toward Elena. "Your death," the voice said. "Your death is 
waiting, Elena. It is-" 

Bonnie seemed to choke. Then she pitched forward and almost landed in her 
dinner plate. 

There was an instant's paralysis, and then everyone moved. Robert jumped up 
and pulled at Bonnie's shoulders, lifting her. Bonnie's skin had gone bluish-white, her 
eyes were closed. Aunt Judith fluttered around her, dabbing at her face with a damp 
napkin. Damon watched with thoughtful, narrowed eyes. 

"She's all right," Robert said, looking up in obvious relief. "I think she just 
fainted. It must have been some kind of hysterical attack." But Elena didn't breathe 
again until Bonnie opened groggy eyes and asked what everyone was staring at. 

It put an effective end to the dinner. Robert insisted that Bonnie be taken home at 
once, and in the activity that followed Elena found time for a whispered word with 


Damon. 

Damon. 

He raised his eyebrows. "What?" 

"I said, get out! Now! Go. Or I'll tell them you're the killer." 

He looked reproachful. "Don't you think a guest deserves a little more 
consideration?" he said, but at her expression he shrugged and smiled. 

"Thank you for having me for dinner," he said aloud to Aunt Judith, who was 
walking past carrying a blanket to the car. "I hope I can return the favor sometime." 
To Elena he added, "Be seeing you." 

Page 89 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
Well, that was clear enough, Elena thought, as Robert drove away with a somber 
Matt and a sleepy Bonnie. Aunt Judith was on the phone with Mrs. McCullough. 


"I don't know what it is with these girls, either," she said. "First Vickie, now 
Bonnie... and Elena has not been herself lately..." 


While Aunt Judith talked and Margaret searched for the missing Snowball, Elena 
paced. 


She would have to call Stefan. That was all there was to it. She wasn't worried 
about Bonnie; the other times this had happened hadn't seemed to do permanent 
damage. And Damon would have better things to do than harass Elena's friends 
tonight. 


He was coming here, to collect for the "favor" he'd done her. She knew without a 
doubt that that was the meaning of his final words. And it meant she would have to 
tell Stefan everything, because she needed him tonight, needed his protection. 


Only, what could Stefan do? Despite all her pleas and arguments last week, he 
had refused to take her blood. He'd insisted that his Powers would return without it, 
but Elena knew he was still vulnerable right now. Even if Stefan were here, could he 
stop Damon? Could he do it without being killed himself? 


Bonnie's house was no refuge. And Meredith was gone. There was no one to help 
her, no one she could trust. But the thought of waiting here alone tonight, knowing 
that Damon was coming, was unbearable. 


She heard Aunt Judith click down the receiver. Automatically, she moved toward 
the kitchen, Stefan's number running through her mind. Then she stopped, and 
slowly turned around to look at the living room she'd just left. 


She looked at the floor to ceiling windows and at the elaborate fireplace with its 
beautifully scrolled molding. This room was part of the original house, the one that 
had almost completely burned in the Civil War. Her own bedroom was just above. 


A great light was beginning to dawn. Elena looked at the molding around the 
ceiling, at where it joined the more modern dining room. Then she almost ran toward 
the stairs, her heart beating fast. 


"Aunt Judith?" Her aunt paused on the stairway. "Aunt Judith, tell me something. 


. 
Did Damon go into the living room?" 


Did Damon go into the living room?" 


"Did Robert take Damon into the living room? Please think, Aunt Judith! I need to 
know." 


"Why, no, I don't think so. No, he didn't. They came in and went straight to the 
dining room. Elena, what on earth?..." This last as Elena impulsively threw her arms 


Page 90 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
around her and hugged her. 


"Sorry, Aunt Judith. I'm just happy," said Elena. Smiling, she turned to go back 
down the stairs. 


"Well, I'm glad someone's happy, after the way dinner turned out. Although that 
nice boy, Damon, seemed to enjoy himself. Do you know, Elena, he seemed quite 
taken with you, in spite of the way you were acting." 


Elena turned back around. "So?" 


"Well, I just thought you might give him a chance, that's all. I thought he was very 
pleasant. The kind of young man I like to see around here." 


Elena goggled a moment, then swallowed to keep the hysterical laughter from 
escaping. Her aunt was suggesting that she take up Damon instead of Stefan... 
because Damon was safer. The kind of nice young man any aunt would like. "Aunt 
Judith," she began, gasping, but then she realized it was useless. She shook her head 
mutely, throwing her hands up in defeat, and watched her aunt go up the stairs. 


Usually Elena slept with her door closed. But tonight she left it open and lay on 
her bed gazing out into the darkened hallway. Every so often she glanced at the 
luminous numbers of the clock on the nightstand beside her. 


There was no danger that she would fall asleep. As the minutes crawled by, she 
almost began to wish she could. Time moved with agonizing slowness. Eleven 
o'clock... eleven thirty... midnight. One a.m. One thirty. Two. 


At 2:10 she heard a sound. 


She listened, still lying on her bed, to the faint whisper of noise downstairs. She'd 
known he would find a way to get in if he wanted. If Damon was that determined, no 
lock would keep him out. 


Music from the dream she'd had that night at Bonnie's tinkled through her mind, a 
handful of plaintive, silvery notes. It woke strange feelings inside her. Almost in a 
daze or dream herself, she got up and went to stand at the threshold. 


The hallway was dark, but her eyes had had a long time to adjust. She could see 
the darker silhouette making its way up the stairs. When it reached the top she saw 
the swift, deadly glimmer of his smile. 


She waited, unsmiling, until he reached her and stood facing her, with only a yard 
of hardwood floor between them. The house was completely silent. Across the hall 


. 
Margaret slept; at the end of the passage, Aunt Judith lay wrapped in dreams, 
unaware of what was going on outside her door. 


Margaret slept; at the end of the passage, Aunt Judith lay wrapped in dreams, 
unaware of what was going on outside her door. 


Page 91 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
She backed up, without a word or gesture of invitation, leaving the doorway 
empty. She saw the quick flare in his bottomless eyes, and watched him come 
eagerly toward her. And watched him stop. 


He stood just outside her room, plainly disconcerted. He tried again to step 
forward but could not. Something seemed to be preventing him from moving any 
farther. On his face, surprise gave way to puzzlement and then anger. 


He looked up, his eyes raking over the lintel, scanning the ceiling on either side of 
the threshold. Then, as the full realization hit him, his lips pulled back from his teeth 
in an animal snarl. 


Safe on her side of the doorway, Elena laughed softly. It had worked. 


"My room and the living room below are all that's left of the old house," she said 
to him. "And, of course, that was a different dwelling place. One you were not 
invited into, and never will be." 


His chest was heaving with anger, his nostrils dilated, his eyes wild. Waves of 
black rage emanated from him. He looked as if he would like to tear the walls down 
with his hands, which were twitching and clenching with fury. 


Triumph and relief made Elena giddy. "You'd better go now," she said. "There's 
nothing for you here." 


One minute more those menacing eyes blazed into hers, and then Damon turned 
around. But he didn't head for the stairway. Instead, he took one step across the hall 
and laid his hand on the door to Margaret's room. 


Elena started forward before she knew what she was doing. She stopped in the 
doorway, grasping the casing trim, her own breath coming hard. 


His head whipped around and he smiled at her, a slow, cruel smile. He twisted the 
doorknob slightly without looking at it. His eyes, like pools of liquid ebony, 
remained on Elena. 


"Your choice," he said. 


Elena stood very still, feeling as if all of winter was inside her. Margaret was just a 
baby. He couldn't mean it; no one could be such a monster as to hurt a 
four-year-old. 


But there was no hint of softness or compassion in Damon's face. He was a 
hunter, killer, and the weak were his prey. She remembered the dreadful animal snarl 
that had transfigured his handsome features, and she knew that she could never leave 


. 
Margaret to him. 


Margaret to him. 


Page 92 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
Death was in the house, Bonnie had said. And now Elena had gone to meet Death 
of her own free will. She bowed her head to conceal the helpless tears that came to 
her eyes. It was over. Damon had won. 

She did not look up to see him advance on her. But she felt the air stir around her, 
making her shiver. And then she was enfolded in soft, endless blackness, which 
wrapped around her like a great bird's wings. 


Thirteen 

Elena stirred, then opened heavy eyelids. Light was showing around the edges of 
the curtains. She found it hard to move, so she lay there on her bed and tried to 
piece together what had happened last night. 

Damon. Damon had come here and threatened Margaret. And so Elena had gone 
to him. He'd won. 

But why hadn't he finished it? Elena lifted a languid hand to touch the side of her 
neck, already knowing what she would find. Yes, there they were: two small 
punctures that were tender and sensitive to pressure. 

Yet she was still alive. He'd stopped short of carrying out his promise. Why? 

Her memories of the last hours were confused and blurry. Only fragments were 
clear. Damon's eyes looking down at her, filling her whole world. The sharp sting at 
her throat. And, later, Damon opening his shirt, Damon's blood welling from a small 
cut in his neck. 

He'd made her drink his blood then. If made was the right word. She didn't 
remember putting up any resistance or feeling any revulsion. By then, she had 
wanted it. 

But she wasn't dead, or even seriously weakened. He hadn't made her into a 
vampire. And that was what she couldn't understand. 

He has no morals and no conscience, she reminded herself. So it certainly wasn't 
mercy that stopped him. He probably just wants to draw the game out, make you 
suffer more before he kills you. Or maybe he wants you to be like Vickie, with one 
foot in the shadow world and one in the light. Going slowly mad that way. 

One thing was sure: she wouldn't be fooled into thinking it was kindness on his 
part. Damon wasn't capable of kindness. Or of caring for anybody but himself. 

Pushing the blankets back, she rose from the bed. She could hear Aunt Judith 
moving around in the hallway. It was Monday morning and she had to get ready to 
go to school. 

November 17, Wednesday 

Page 93 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
Dear Diary, 


It's no good pretending I'm not frightened, because I am. Tomorrow's 
Thanksgiving, and Founders' Day is two days after that. And I still haven't figured 
out a way to stop Caroline and Tyler. 


I don't know what to do. If I can't get my diary back from Caroline, she's going 
to read it in front of everyone. She'll have a perfect opportunity; she's one of the 
three seniors chosen to read poetry during the closing ceremonies. Chosen by the 
school board, of which Tyler's father is a member, I might add. I wonder what 


. 
he'll think when this is all over? 


he'll think when this is all over? 


Which means I have to find a way to get the diary. I have to. 


But I can't. 


I know, you're waiting for me to say it. There is a way to get my diary-
Damon's way. All I need to do is agree to his price. 


But you don't understand how much that frightens me. Not just because Damon 
frightens me, but because I'm afraid of what will happen if he and I are together 
again. I'm afraid of what will happen to me... and to me and Stefan. 


I can't talk about this any more. It's too upsetting. I feel so confused and lost 
and alone. There's nobody I can turn to or talk to. Nobody who could possibly 
understand. 


What am I going to do? 


November 28, Thursday, 11:30 prev.m.


Dear Diary, 


Things seem clearer today, maybe because I've come to a decision. It's a 
decision that terrifies me, but it's better than the only alternative I can think of. 


I'm going to tell Stefan everything. 


It's the only thing I can do now. Founders' Day is Saturday and I haven't come 
up with any plan of my own. But maybe Stefan can, if he realizes how desperate 
the situation is. I'm going over to spend the day at the boarding house tomorrow, 
and when I get there I'm going to tell him everything I should have told him in the 
first place. 


Everything. About Damon, too. 


Page 94 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
I don't know what he'll say. I keep remembering his face in my dreams. The 
way he looked at me, with such bitterness and anger. Not as if he loved me at all. 
If he looks at me like that tomorrow... 

Oh, I'm scared. My stomach is churning. I could barely touch Thanksgiving 
dinner-and I can't keep still I feel as if I might fly apart into a million pieces. Go 
to sleep tonight? Ha. 

Please let Stefan understand. Please let him forgive me. 

The funniest thing is, I wanted to become a better person for him. I wanted to 
be worthy of his love. Stefan has these ideas about honor, about what's right and 
wrong. And now, when he finds out how I've been lying to him, what will he think 
of me? Will he believe me, that I was only trying to protect him? Will he ever trust 


me again? 

me again? 

Elena slipped out of the house without telling Aunt Judith where she was going. 
She was tired of lies, but she didn't want to face the fuss there would inevitably be if 
she said she was going to Stefan's. Ever since Damon had come to dinner, Aunt 
Judith had been talking about him, throwing subtle and not-so-subtle hints into every 
conversation. And Robert was almost as bad. Elena sometimes thought he egged 
Aunt Judith on. 

She leaned on the doorbell of the boarding house wearily. Where was Mrs. 
Flowers these days? When the door finally opened, Stefan was behind it. 

He was dressed for outdoors, his jacket collar turned up. "I thought we could go 
for a walk," he said. 

"No." Elena was firm. She couldn't manage a real smile for him, so she stopped 
trying. She said, "Let's go upstairs, Stefan, all right? There's something we need to 
talk about." 

He looked at her a moment in surprise. Something must have shown in her face, 
for his expression gradually stilled and darkened. He took a deep breath and 
nodded. Without a word, he turned and led the way to his room. 

The trunks and dressers and bookcases had long since been put back into order, 
of course. But Elena felt as if she was really noticing this for the first time. For some 
reason, she thought of the very first night she'd been here, when Stefan had saved 
her from Tyler's disgusting embrace. Her eyes ran over the objects on the dresser: 
the fifteenth century gold florins, the ivory-hiked dagger, the little iron coffer with the 
hinged lid. She'd tried to open that the first night and he'd slammed the lid down. 

She turned. Stefan was standing by the window, outlined by the rectangle of gray 
and dismal sky. Every day this week had been chilly and misty, and this was no 
exception. Stefan's expression mirrored the weather outside. 

Page 95 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
"Well," he said quietly, "what do we need to talk about?" 

There was one last moment of choice, and then Elena committed herself. She 
stretched out a hand to the small iron coffer and opened it. 

Inside, a length of apricot silk shone with muted luster. Her hair ribbon. It 
reminded her of summer, of summer days that seemed impossibly far away just 
now. She gathered it up and held it out to Stefan. 

"About this," she said. 

He had taken a step forward when she touched the coffer, but now he looked 
puzzled and surprised. "About that?" 

"Yes. Because I knew it was there, Stefan. I found it a long time ago, one day 
when you left the room for a few minutes. I don't know why I had to know what was 


in there, but I couldn't help it. So I found the ribbon. And then..." She stopped and 
braced herself. "Then I wrote about it in my diary." 

in there, but I couldn't help it. So I found the ribbon. And then..." She stopped and 
braced herself. "Then I wrote about it in my diary." 

"I wrote about it because I thought it was evidence that you'd cared about me all 
along, enough to pick it up and keep it. I never thought it could be evidence of 
anything else." 

Then, suddenly, she was speaking quickly. She told him about taking her diary to 
Bonnie's house, about how it had been stolen. She told him about getting the notes, 
about realizing that Caroline was the one who was sending them. And then, turning 
away, pulling the summer-colored silk over and over through her nervous fingers, 
she told him about Caroline and Tyler's plan. 

Her voice almost gave out at the end. "I've been so frightened since then," she 
whispered, her eyes still on the ribbon. "Scared that you'd be angry with me. Scared 
of what they're going to do. Just scared. I tried to get the diary back, Stefan, I even 
went to Caroline's house. But she has it too well hidden. 

And I've thought and thought, but I can't think of any way of stopping her from 
reading it." At last she looked up at him. "I'm sorry." 

"You should be!" he said, startling her with his vehemence. She felt the blood 
drain from her face. But Stefan was going on. "You should be sorry for keeping 
something like that from me when I could have helped you. Elena, why didn't you 
just tell me?" 

"Because it's all my fault. And I had a dream..." She tried to describe how he had 
looked in the dreams, the bitterness, the accusation in his eyes. "I think I would die if 
you really looked at me that way," she concluded miserably. 

Page 96 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
But Stefan's expression as he looked at her now was a combination of relief and 
wonder. "So that's it," he said, almost in a whisper himself. "That's what's been 
bothering you." 

Elena opened her mouth, but he was still speaking. "I knew something was wrong, 
I knew you were holding something back. But I thought..." He shook "his head and 
a skewed smile tugged at his lips. "It doesn't matter now. I didn't want to invade 
your privacy. I didn't even want to ask. And all the time you were worried about 
protecting me." 

Elena's tongue was stuck to the roof of her mouth. The words seemed to be 
stuck, too. There's more, she thought, but she couldn't say it, not when Stefan's 
eyes looked like that, not when his whole face was alight that way. 

"When you said we needed to talk today, I thought you'd changed your mind 
about me," he said simply, without self-pity. "And I wouldn't have blamed you. But 
instead..." He shook his head again. "Elena," he said, and then she was in his arms. 

It felt so good to be there, so right. She hadn't even realized how wrong things 
had been between them until now, when the wrongness had disappeared. This was 


what she remembered, what she had felt that first glorious night when Stefan had 
held her. All the sweetness and tenderness in the world surging between them. She 
was home, where she belonged. Where she would always belong. 

what she remembered, what she had felt that first glorious night when Stefan had 
held her. All the sweetness and tenderness in the world surging between them. She 
was home, where she belonged. Where she would always belong. 

As she had in the beginning, Elena felt as if she could almost read Stefan's 
thoughts. They were connected, a part of each other. Their hearts beat to the same 
rhythm. 

Only one thing was needed to make it complete. Elena knew that, and she tossed 
her hair back, reaching from behind to pull it away from the side of her neck. And 
this time Stefan did not protest or thwart her. Instead of refusal he was radiating a 
deep acceptance -and a deep need. 

Feelings of love, of delight, of appreciation overwhelmed her and with 
incredulous joy she realized the feelings were his. For a moment, she sensed herself 
through his eyes, and sensed how much he cared for her. It might have been 
frightening if she had not had the same depth of feeling to give back to him. 

She felt no pain as his teeth pierced her neck. And it didn't even occur to her that 
she had unthinkingly offered him the unmarked side-even though the wounds 
Damon had left were healed already. 

She clung to him when he tried to lift his head. He was adamant, though, and at 
last she had to let him do it. Still holding her, he groped over onto the dresser for the 

Page 97 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
wicked ivory-handled blade and with one quick motion he let his own blood flow. 

When Elena's knees grew weak, he sat her on the bed. And then they just held 
each other, unaware of time or anything else. Elena felt that only she and Stefan 
existed. 

"I love you," he said softly. 

At first Elena, in her pleasant haze, simply accepted the words. Then, with a chill 
of sweetness, she realized what he'd said. 

He loved her. She'd known it all along, but he had never said it before. 

"I love you, Stefan," she whispered back. She was surprised when he shifted and 
pulled away slightly, until she saw what he was doing. Reaching inside his sweater, 
he drew out the chain he had worn around his neck ever since she had known him. 
On the chain was a gold ring, exquisitely crafted, set with lapis lazuli. 

Katherine's ring. As Elena watched, he took the chain off and unclasped it, 
removing the delicate golden band. 

"When Katherine died," he said, "I thought I could never love anyone else. Even 
though I knew she would have wanted me to, I was sure it could never happen. But I 
was wrong." He hesitated a moment and then went on. 

"I kept the ring because it was a symbol of her. So I could keep her in my heart. 
But now I'd like it to be a symbol of something else." Again he hesitated, seeming 
almost afraid to meet her eyes. "Considering the way things are, I don't really have 


any right to ask this. But, Elena-" He struggled on for a few minutes and then gave 
up, his eyes meeting hers mutely. 

any right to ask this. But, Elena-" He struggled on for a few minutes and then gave 
up, his eyes meeting hers mutely. 

"You're right," he said. "It's all impossible. There are just too many difficulties-
because of me. Because of what I am. Nobody like you should be tied to someone 
like me. I shouldn't even have suggested it-" 

"Stefan!" said Elena. "Stefan, if you'll be quiet a moment-" 

"-so just forget I said anything-" 

"Stefan!" she said. "Stefan, look at me." 

Slowly, he obeyed, turning back. He looked into her eyes, and the bitter 
self-condemnation faded from his face, to be replaced by a look that made her lose 
her breath again. Then, still slowly, he took the hand she was holding out. 
Deliberately, as they both watched, he slipped the ring onto her finger. 

Page 98 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
It fit as if it had been made for her. The gold glinted richly in the light, and the 
lapis shone a deep vibrant blue like a clear lake surrounded by untouched snow. 

"We'll have to keep it a secret for a while," she said, hearing the tremor in her 
voice. 

"Aunt Judith will have a fit if she knows I'm engaged before I graduate. But I'll be 
eighteen next summer, and then she can't stop us." 

"Elena, are you sure this is what you want? It won't be easy living with me. I'll 
always be different from you, no matter how I try. If you ever want to change your 
mind..." 

"As long as you love me, I'll never change my mind." 

He took her in his arms again, and peace and contentment enfolded her. But there 
was still one fear that gnawed at the edges of her consciousness. 

"Stefan, about tomorrow-if Caroline and Tyler carry out their plan, it won't 
matter if I change my mind or not." 

"Then we'll just have to make sure they can't carry it out. If Bonnie and Meredith 
will help me, I think I can find a way to get the diary from Caroline. But even if I 
can't, I'm not going to run. I won't leave you, Elena; I'm going to stay and fight." 

"But they'll hurt you. Stefan, I can't stand that." 

"And I can't leave you. That's settled. Let me worry about the rest of it; I'll find a 
way. And if I don't... well, no matter what I'll stay with you. We'll be together." 

"We'll be together," Elena repeated, and rested her head on his shoulder, happy to 
stop thinking for a while and just be. 

November 29, Friday 


Dear Diary, 

Dear Diary, 

Well, tomorrow's the day. 

We talked to Bonnie and Meredith tonight. Stefan's plan is simplicity itself. The 
thing is, no matter where Caroline has hidden the diary, she has to bring it out 
tomorrow to take it with her. But our readings are the last thing on the agenda, 
and she has to be in the parade and everything first. She'll have to stash the diary 
somewhere during that time. So if we watch her from the minute she leaves her 
house until she gets up on stage, we should be able to see where she puts it down. 
And since she doesn't even know we're suspicious, she won't be on guard. 

That's when we get it. 

Page 99 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
The reason the plan will work is because everyone in the program will be in 
period dress. Mrs. Grimesby, the librarian, will help us put on our 19th century 
clothes before the parade, and we can't be wearing or carrying anything that's not 
part of the costume. No purses, no backpacks. No diaries! Caroline will have to 
leave it behind at some point. 

We're taking turns watching her. Bonnie is going to wait outside her house and 
see what Caroline's carrying when she leaves. I'll watch her when she gets dressed 
at Mrs. Grimesby's house. Then, while the parade is going on, Stefan and 
Meredith will break into the house-or the Forbes' car, if that's where it is-and 
do their stuff. 

I don't see how it can fail. And I can't tell you how much better I feel. It's so 
good just to be able to share this problem with Stefan. I've learned my lesson; I'll 
never keep things from him again. 

I'm wearing my ring tomorrow. If Mrs. Grimesby asks me about it, I'll tell her 
it's even older than 19th century, it's from Renaissance Italy. I'd like to see her face 
when I say that. 

I'd better try to get some sleep now. I hope I don't dream.

Bonnie shivered as she waited outside the tall Victorian house. The air was frosty 
this morning, and although it was almost eight o'clock the sun had never really come 
up. The sky was just one dense massed bank of gray and white clouds, creating an 
eerie twilight below. 

She had begun to stamp her feet and rub her hands together when the Forbes' 
door opened. Bonnie moved back a little behind the shrubbery that was her hiding 
place and watched the family walk to their car. Mr. Forbes was carrying nothing but 
a camera. Mrs. Forbes had a purse and a folding seat. Daniel Forbes, Caroline's 
younger brother, had another seat. And Caroline... 

Bonnie leaned forward, her breath hissing out in satisfaction. Caroline was 
dressed in jeans and a heavy sweater, and she was carrying some sort of white 
drawstring purse. Not big but big enough to hold a small diary. 

Warmed by triumph, Bonnie waited behind the bush until the car drove away. 
Then she started for the corner of Thrush Street and Hawthorne Drive. 

"There she is, Aunt Judith. On the corner." 

The car slowed to a halt, and Bonnie slid into the back seat with Elena. 

"She's got a white drawstring purse," she murmured into Elena's ear as Aunt 
Judith pulled out again. 

00 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
Tingling excitement swept over Elena, and she squeezed Bonnie's hand. "Good," 
she breathed. "Now we'll see if she brings it into Mrs. Grimesby's. If not, you tell 
Meredith it's in the car." 


Bonnie nodded agreement and squeezed Elena's hand back. 


They arrived at Mrs. Grimesby's just in time to see Caroline going inside with a 
white bag hanging from her arm. Bonnie and Elena exchanged a look. Now it was up 
to Elena to see where Caroline left it in the house. 


"I'll get out here too, Miss Gilbert," said Bonnie as Elena jumped out of the car. 
She would wait outside with Meredith until Elena could tell them where the bag was. 
The important thing was not to let Caroline suspect anything unusual. 


Mrs. Grimesby, who answered Elena's knock, was the Fell's Church librarian. Her 
house looked almost like a library itself; there were bookcases everywhere and 
books stacked on the floor. She was also the keeper of Fell's Church's historical 
artifacts, including clothing that had been preserved from the town's earliest days. 


Just now the house was ringing with young voices, and the bedrooms were full of 
students in various stages of undress. Mrs. Grimesby always supervised the 
costumes for the pageant. Elena was ready to ask to be put in the same room with 
Caroline, but it wasn't necessary. Mrs. Grimesby was already ushering her in. 


. 
Caroline, stripped down to her fashionable underwear, gave Elena what was 
undoubtedly meant to be a nonchalant look, but Elena detected the vicious gloating 
beneath. She kept her own eyes on the bundle of clothing Mrs. Grimesby was 
picking up off the bed. 


Caroline, stripped down to her fashionable underwear, gave Elena what was 
undoubtedly meant to be a nonchalant look, but Elena detected the vicious gloating 
beneath. She kept her own eyes on the bundle of clothing Mrs. Grimesby was 
picking up off the bed. 


"It's beautiful," said Elena, as Mrs. Grimesby shook out the folds of thin white 
material. "What's it made of?" 


"Moravian muslin and silk gauze. Since it's quite cold today you can wear that 
velvet jacket over it." The librarian indicated a dusty rose garment lying over a chair 
back. 


Elena cast a surreptitious glance at Caroline as she began to change. Yes, there 
was the bag, at Caroline's feet. She debated making a grab for it, but Mrs. Grimesby 
was still in the room. 


The muslin dress was very simple, its flowing material belted high under the 
bosom with a pale rose ribbon. The slightly puffed elbow-length sleeves were tied 
with ribbon of the same color. Fashions had been loose enough in the early 
nineteenth century to fit a twentieth century girl-at least if she were slender. Elena

L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
smiled as Mrs. Grimesby led her to a mirror. 


"Did it really belong to Honoria Fell?" she asked, thinking of the marble image of 
that lady lying on her tomb in the ruined church. 


"That's the story, anyway," said Mrs. Grimesby. "She mentions a dress like it in 
her journal, so we're pretty sure." 


"She kept a journal?" Elena was startled. 


"Oh, yes. I have it in a case in the living room; I'll show it to you on the way out. 
Now for the jacket-oh, what's that?" 


Something violet fluttered to the ground as Elena picked the jacket up. 


She could feel her expression freeze. She caught up the note before Mrs. 
Grimesby could bend over, and glanced at it. 


One line. She remembered writing it in her diary on September 4, the first day of 
school. Except that after she had written it she had crossed it out. These words were 
not crossed out; they were bold and clear. 


Something awful is going to happen today. 


Elena could barely restrain herself from rounding on Caroline and shaking the note 
in her face. But that would ruin everything. She forced herself to stay calm as she 
crumpled up the little slip of paper and threw it into a wastebasket. 


"It's just a piece of trash," she said, and turned back to Mrs. Grimesby, her 
shoulders stiff. Caroline said nothing, but Elena could feel those triumphant green 
eyes on her. 


. 
Just you wait, she thought. Wait until I get that diary back. I'm going to burn it, 
and then you and I are going to have a talk. 


Just you wait, she thought. Wait until I get that diary back. I'm going to burn it, 
and then you and I are going to have a talk. 


"So am I," said Caroline in a demure voice. Elena put on a look of cool 
indifference as she eyed the other girl. Caroline's pale green gown with long green 
and white sashes was not nearly as pretty as hers. 


"Wonderful. You girls go ahead and wait for your rides. Oh, and Caroline, don't 
forget your reticule." 


"I won't," Caroline said, smiling, and she reached for the drawstring bag at her 
feet. 


It was fortunate that from that position she couldn't see Elena's face, for in that 
instant the cool indifference shattered completely. Elena stared, dumbfounded, as 


02 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
Caroline began to tie the bag at her waist. 


Her astonishment didn't escape Mrs. Grimesby. "That's a reticule, the ancestor of 
our modern handbag," the older woman explained kindly. "Ladies used to keep their 
gloves and fans in them. Caroline came by and got it earlier this week so she could 
repair some loose beadwork... very thoughtful of her." 


"I'm sure it was," Elena managed in a strangled voice. She had to get out of here 
or something awful was going to happen right now. She was going to start screaming 
-or knock Caroline down-or explode. "I need some fresh air," she said. She 
bolted from the room and from the house, bursting outside. 


Bonnie and Meredith were waiting in Meredith's car. Elena's heart thumped 
strangely as she walked to it and leaned in the window. 


"She's outsmarted us," she said quietly. "That bag is part of her costume, and 
she's going to wear it all day." 


Bonnie and Meredith stared, first at her and then at each other. 


"But... then, what are we going to do?" Bonnie asked. 


"I don't know." With sick dismay this realization finally came home to Elena. "I 
don't know!" 


"We can still watch her. Maybe she'll take the bag off at lunch or something..." 
But Meredith's voice rang hollow. They all knew the truth, Elena thought, and the 
truth was that it was hopeless. They'd lost. 


Bonnie glanced in the rearview mirror, then twisted in her seat. "It's your ride." 


Elena looked. Two white horses were drawing a smartly renovated buggy down 
the street. Crepe paper was threaded through the buggy's wheels, ferns decorated its 
seats, and a large banner on the side proclaimed, The Spirit of Fell's Church. 


Elena had time for only one desperate message. "Watch her," she said. "And if 
there's ever a moment when she's alone..." Then she had to go. 


But all through that long, terrible morning, there was never a moment when 


. 
Caroline was alone. She was surrounded by a crowd of spectators. 


Caroline was alone. She was surrounded by a crowd of spectators. 


Somewhere in front of her, among the marching bands and drill teams and open 
convertibles, was Caroline. Elena had forgotten to find out which float she was on. 
The first schoolhouse float, perhaps; a lot of the younger children in costume would 
be on that. 


It didn't matter. Wherever Caroline was, she was in full view of half the town. 


03 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
The luncheon that followed the parade was held in the high school cafeteria. Elena 
was trapped at a table with Mayor Dawley and his wife. Caroline was at a nearby 
table; Elena could see the shining back of her auburn head. And sitting beside her, 
often leaning possessively over her, was Tyler Smallwood. 


Elena was in a perfect position to view the little drama that occurred about 
halfway through lunch. Her heart leaped into her throat when she saw Stefan, looking 
casual, stroll by Caroline's table. 


He spoke to Caroline. Elena watched, forgetting even to play with the untouched 
food on her plate. But what she saw next made her heart plummet. Caroline tossed 
her head and replied to him briefly, and then turned back to her meal. And Tyler 
lumbered to his feet, his face reddening as he made an angry gesture. He didn't sit 
down again until Stefan turned away. 


Stefan looked toward Elena as he left, and for a moment their eyes met in 
wordless communion. 


There was nothing he could do, then. Even if his Powers had returned, Tyler was 
going to keep him away from Caroline. The crushing weight squeezed Elena's lungs 
so that she could scarcely breathe. 


After that she simply sat in a daze of misery and despair until someone nudged 
her and told her it was time to go backstage. 


She listened almost indifferently to Mayor Dawley's speech of welcome. He 
spoke about the "trying time" Fell's Church had faced recently, and about the 
community spirit that had sustained them these past months. Then awards were 
given out, for scholarship, for athletics, for community service. Matt came up to 
receive Outstanding Male Athlete of the Year, and Elena saw him look at her 
curiously. 


Then came the pageant. The elementary school children giggled and tripped and 
forgot their lines as they portrayed scenes from the founding of Fell's Church 
through the Civil War. Elena watched them without taking any of it in. Ever since last 
night she'd been slightly dizzy and shaky, and now she felt as if she were coming 
down with the flu. Her brain, usually so full of schemes and calculations, was empty. 
She couldn't think anymore. She almost couldn't care. 


The pageant ended to popping flashbulbs and tumultuous applause. When the last 


. 
little Confederate soldier was off the stage, Mayor Dawley called for silence. 


little Confederate soldier was off the stage, Mayor Dawley called for silence. 


The applause was even more thunderous. Elena stood beside John Clifford, the 
brainy senior who'd been chosen to represent the Spirit of Independence. On the 
other side of John was Caroline. In a detached, nearly apathetic way Elena noticed 
that Caroline looked magnificent: her head tilted back, her eyes blazing, her cheeks 


04 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
flushed with color. 

John went first, adjusting his glasses and the microphone before he read from the 
heavy brown book on the lectern. Officially, the seniors were free to choose their 
own selections; in practice they almost always read from the works of M. C. Marsh, 
the only poet Fell's Church had ever produced. 

All during John's reading, Caroline was upstaging him. She smiled at the audience; 
she shook out her hair; she weighed the reticule hanging from her waist. Her fingers 
stroked the drawstring bag lovingly, and Elena found herself staring at it, hypnotized, 
memorizing every bead. 

John took a bow and resumed his place by Elena. Caroline threw her shoulders 
back and did a model's walk to the lectern. 

This time the applause was mixed with whistles. But Caroline didn't smile; she had 
assumed an air of tragic responsibility. With exquisite timing she waited until the 
cafetorium was perfectly quiet to speak. 

"I was planning to read a poem by M. C. Marsh today," she said, then, into the 
attentive stillness, "but I'm not going to. Why read from this-" She held up the 
nineteenth century volume of poetry. "-when there is something much more... 
relevant... in a book I happened to find?" 

Happened to steal, you mean, thought Elena. Her eyes sought among the faces in 
the crowd, and she located Stefan. He was standing toward the back, with Bonnie 
and Meredith stationed on either side as if protecting him. Then Elena noticed 
something else. Tyler, with Dick and several other guys, was standing just a few 
yards behind. The guys were older than high school age, and they looked tough, and 
there were five of them. Go, thought Elena, finding Stefan's eyes again. She willed 
him to understand what she was saying. Go, Stefan; please leave before it happens. 
Go now. 

Very slightly, almost imperceptibly, Stefan shook his head. 

Caroline's fingers were dipping into the bag as if she just couldn't wait. "What I'm 
going to read is about Fell's Church today, not a hundred or two hundred years 
ago," she was saying, working herself up into a sort of exultant fever. "It's important 
now, because it's about somebody who's living in town with us. In fact he's right 
here in this room." 

Tyler must have written the speech for her, Elena decided. Last month, in the 


gym, he'd shown quite a gift for that kind of thing. Oh, Stefan, oh, Stefan, I'm 
scared... Her thoughts jumbled into incoherence as Caroline plunged her hand into 
the bag.

L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
Elena had almost lost consciousness when Caroline jerked the diary out. Bright 
sparkles ran along the edges of her vision. The dizziness roared up, ready to 
overwhelm Elena, and then she noticed something. 

It must be her eyes. The stage lights and flashbulbs must have dazzled them. She 
certainly felt ready to faint any minute; it was hardly surprising that she couldn't see 
properly. 

The book in Caroline's hands looked green, not blue. 

I must be going crazy... or this is a dream... or maybe it's a trick of the lighting. 
But look at Caroline's face! 

Caroline, mouth working, was staring at the velvet book. She seemed to have 
forgotten the audience altogether. She turned the diary over and over in her hands, 
looking at all sides of it. Her movements became frantic. She thrust a hand into the 
reticule as if she somehow hoped to find something else in it. Then she cast a wild 
glance around the stage as if what she was looking for might have fallen to the 
ground. 

The audience was murmuring, getting impatient. Mayor Dawley and the high 
school principal were exchanging tight-lipped frowns. 

Having found nothing on the floor, Caroline was staring at the small book again. 
But now she was gazing at it as if it were a scorpion. With a sudden gesture, she 
wrenched it open and looked inside, as if her last hope was that only the cover had 
changed and the words inside might be Elena's. 

Then she slowly looked up from the book at the packed cafetorium. 

Silence had descended again, and the moment drew out, while every eye remained 
fixed on the girl in the pale green gown. Then, with an inarticulate sound, Caroline 
whirled and clattered off the stage. She struck at Elena as she went by, her face a 
mask of rage and hatred. 

Gently, with a feeling of floating, Elena stooped to pick up what Caroline had 
tried to hit her with. 

Caroline's diary. 

There was activity behind Elena as people ran after Caroline, and in front of her as 
the audience exploded into comment, argument, discussion. Elena found Stefan. He 
looked as if jubilation was sneaking up on him. But he also looked as bewildered as 


Elena felt. Bonnie and Meredith were the same. As Stefan's gaze crossed hers, Elena 
felt a rush of gratitude and joy, but her predominant emotion was awe.

L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
And then her eyes picked out another dark head among the crowd. 

Damon was leaning... no, lounging... against the north wall. His lips were curved 
into a half smile, and his eyes met Elena's boldly. 
Mayor Dawley was beside her, urging her forward, quieting the crowd, trying to 

restore order. It was no use. Elena read her selection in a dreamy voice to a babbling 
group of people who weren't paying attention in the slightest. She wasn't paying 
attention, either; she had no idea what words she was saying. Every so often she 
looked at Damon. 

There was applause, scattered and distracted, when she finished, and the mayor 
announced the rest of the events for that afternoon. And then it was all over, and 
Elena was free to go. 

She floated offstage without any conscious idea of where she was going, but her 
legs carried her to the north wall. Damon's dark head moved out the side door and 
she followed it. 

The air in the courtyard seemed deliciously cool after the crowded room, and the 

clouds above were silvery and swirling. Damon was waiting for her. 
Her steps slowed but did not stop. She moved until she was only a foot or so 
away from him, her eyes searching his face. 


There was a long moment of silence and then she spoke. "Why?" 


"I thought you'd be more interested in how." He patted his jacket significantly. "I 
got invited in for coffee this morning after scraping up an acquaintance last week." 
"But why?" 
He shrugged, and for just an instant something like consternation flickered across 


his finely drawn features. It seemed to Elena that he himself didn't know why-or 
didn't want to admit it. 
"For my own purposes," he said. 
"I don't think so." Something was building between them, something that 
frightened Elena with its power. "I don't think that's the reason at all." 
There was a dangerous glimmer in those dark eyes. "Don't push me, Elena." 


She moved closer, so that she was almost touching him, and looked at him. "I 
think," she said, "that maybe you need to be pushed." 
His face was only inches away from hers, and Elena never knew what might have 


happened if at that moment a voice hadn't broken in on them. 


07 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
"You did manage to make it after all! I'm so glad!" 

It was Aunt Judith. Elena felt as if she were being whisked from one world to 


another. She blinked dizzily, stepping back, letting out a breath she hadn't realized 
she was holding. 

another. She blinked dizzily, stepping back, letting out a breath she hadn't realized 
she was holding. 

"Nerves," suggested Damon, his face carefully solemn. Elena felt an urge to giggle 
and then a wave of irritation. It was all very well to be grateful to Damon for saving 
them, but if not for Damon there wouldn't have been a problem in the first place. 
Damon had committed the crimes Caroline wanted to pin on Stefan. 

"And where is Stefan?" she said, voicing her next thought aloud. She could see 
Bonnie and Meredith in the courtyard alone. 

Aunt Judith's face showed her disapproval. "I haven't seen him," she said briefly. 
Then she smiled fondly. "But I have an idea; why don't you come to dinner with us, 
Damon? Then afterwards perhaps you and Elena could-" 

"Stop it!" said Elena to Damon. He looked politely inquiring. 

"What?" said Aunt Judith. 

"Stop it!" Elena said to Damon again. "You know what. Just stop it right now!" 


Fifteen 

"Elena, you're being rude!" Aunt Judith seldom got angry but she was angry now. 
"You're too old for this kind of behavior." 

"It's not rudeness! You don't understand-" 

"I understand perfectly. You're acting just the way you did when Damon came to 
dinner. Don't you think a guest deserves a little more consideration?" 

Frustration flooded over Elena. "You don't even know what you're talking about," 
she said. This was too much. To hear Damon's words coming from Aunt Judith's 
lips... it was unbearable. 

"Elena!" A mottled flush was creeping up Aunt Judith's cheeks. "I'm shocked at 
you! And I have to say that this childish behavior only started since you've been 
going out with that boy." 

"Oh, 'that boy'." Elena glared at Damon. 

08 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
"Yes, that boy!" Aunt Judith answered. "Ever since you lost your head over him 
you've been a different person. Irresponsible, secretive-and defiant! He's been a 
bad influence from the start, and I won't tolerate it any more." 

"Oh, really?" Elena felt as if she were talking to Damon and Aunt Judith at once, 
and she looked back and forth between the two of them. All the emotions she'd been 
suppressing for the last days-for the last weeks, for the months since Stefan had 
come into her life-were surging forward. It was like a great tidal wave inside her, 
over which she had no control. 

She realized she was shaking. "Well, that's too bad because you're going to have 
to tolerate it. I am never going to give Stefan up, not for anyone. Certainly not for 
you!" This last was meant for Damon, but Aunt Judith gasped. 

"That's enough!" Robert snapped. He'd appeared with Margaret, and his face was 
dark. "Young lady, if this is how that boy encourages you to speak to your aunt-" 

"He's not 'that boy'!" Elena took another step back, so she could face all of them. 
She was making a spectacle of herself, everyone in the courtyard was looking. But 
she didn't care. She had been keeping a lid on her feelings for so long, shoving down 
all the anxiety and the fear and the anger where it wouldn't be seen. All the worry 
about Stefan, all the terror over Damon, all the shame and humiliation she'd suffered 
at school, she'd buried it deep. But now it was coming back. All of it, all at once, in 
a maelstrom of impossible violence. Her heart was pounding crazily; her ears rang. 
She felt that nothing mattered except to hurt the people who stood in front of her, to 
show them all. 

"He's not 'that boy'," she said again, her voice deadly cold. "He's Stefan and he's 
all I care about. And I happen to be engaged to him." 

"Oh, don't be ridiculous!" Robert thundered. It was the last straw. 


"Is this ridiculous?" She held up her hand, the ring toward them. "We're going to 
get married!" 

"Is this ridiculous?" She held up her hand, the ring toward them. "We're going to 
get married!" 

"Elena, I absolutely forbid you-" 

"You're not my mother!" Elena cried. Tears were trying to force themselves out 
of her eyes. She needed to get away, to be alone, to be with someone who loved 
her. "If Stefan asks, tell him I'll be at the boarding house!" she added, and broke 
away through the crowd. 

She half expected Bonnie or Meredith to follow her, but she was glad they didn't. 
The parking lot was full of cars but almost empty of people. Most of the families 
were staying for the afternoon activities. But a battered Ford sedan was parked 
nearby, and a familiar figure was unlocking the door. 

09 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
"Matt! Are you leaving?" She made her decision instantly. It was too cold to walk 
all the way to the boarding house. 


"Huh? No, I've got to help Coach Lyman take the tables down. I was just putting 
this away." He tossed the Outstanding Athlete placard into the front seat. "Hey, are 
you okay?" His eyes widened at the sight of her face. 


"Yes-no. I will be if I can get out of here. Look, can I take your car? Just for a 
little while?" 


"Well... sure, but... I know, why don't you let me drive you? I'll go tell Coach 
Lyman." 


"No! I just want to be alone... Oh, please don't ask any questions." She almost 
snatched the keys out of his hand. "I'll bring it back soon, I promise. Or Stefan will. 
If you see Stefan, tell him I'm at the boarding house. And thanks." She slammed the 
door on his protests and revved the engine, pulling out with a clash of gears because 
she wasn't used to a stick shift. She left him standing there staring after her. 


She drove without really seeing or hearing anything outside, crying, locked in her 
own spinning tornado of emotions. She and Stefan would run away... They would 
elope... They would show everyone. She would never set foot in Fell's Church 
again. 


And then Aunt Judith would be sorry. Then Robert would see how wrong he'd 
been. But Elena would never forgive them. Never. 


As for Elena herself, she didn't need anybody. She certainly didn't need stupid 
old Robert E. Lee, where you could go from being mega-popular to being a social 
pariah in one day just for loving the wrong person. She didn't need any family, or 
any friends, either... 


Slowing down to cruise up the winding driveway of the boarding house, Elena felt 


. 
her thoughts slow down, too. 


her thoughts slow down, too. 


In spite of herself Elena felt a strangled giggle well up in her throat. Poor Matt. 
People always borrowing his clunking dinosaur of a car. He must think she and 
Stefan were nuts. 


The giggle let loose a few more tears and she sat and wiped them off, shaking her 
head. Oh, God, how did things turn out this way? What a day. She should be having 
a victory celebration because they'd beaten Caroline, and instead she was crying 
alone in Matt's car. 


Caroline had looked pretty damn funny, though. Elena's body shook gently with 
slightly hysterical chuckles. Oh, the look on her face. Somebody better have a video 


10 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
of that. 


At last the sobs and giggles both abated and Elena felt a wash of tiredness. She 
leaned against the steering wheel trying not to think of anything for a while, and then 
she got out of the car. 


She'd go and wait for Stefan, and then they'd both go back and deal with the 
mess she'd made. It would take a lot of cleaning up, she thought wearily. Poor Aunt 
Judith. Elena had yelled at her in front of half the town. 


Why had she let herself get so upset? But her emotions were still close to the 
surface, as she found when the boarding house door was locked and no one 
answered the bell. 


Oh, wonderful she thought, her eyes stinging again. Mrs. Flowers had gone off to 
the Founders' Day celebration, too. And now Elena had the choice of sitting in the 
car or standing out here in this windstorm... 


It was the first time she'd noticed the weather, but when she did she looked 
around in alarm. The day had started out cloudy and chilly, but now there was a mist 
flowing along the ground, as if breathed out from the surrounding fields. The clouds 
were not just swirling, they were seething. And the wind was getting stronger. 


It moaned through the branches of the oak trees, tearing off the remaining leaves 
and sending them down in showers. The sound was rising steadily now, not just a 
moan but a howl. 


And there was something else. Something that came not just from the wind, but 
from the air itself, or the space around the air. A feeling of pressure, of menace, of 
some unimaginable force. It was gathering power, drawing nearer, closing in. 


Elena spun to face the oak trees. 


There was a stand of them behind the house, and more beyond, blending into the 
forest. And beyond that were the river and the graveyard. 


Something... was out there. Something... very bad... 


. 
"No," whispered Elena. She couldn't see it, but she could feel it, like some great 
shape rearing up to stand over her, blotting out the sky. She felt the evil, the hatred, 
the animal fury. 


"No," whispered Elena. She couldn't see it, but she could feel it, like some great 
shape rearing up to stand over her, blotting out the sky. She felt the evil, the hatred, 
the animal fury. 


"No!" 


Higher and higher, it was towering over her. She could still see nothing, but it was 
as if great wings unfolded, stretching to touch the horizon on either side. Something 


11 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
with a Power beyond comprehension... and it wanted to kill... 


"No!" She ran for the car just as it stooped and dived for her. Her hands 
scrabbled at the door handle, and she fumbled frantically with the keys. The wind 
was screaming, shrieking, tearing at her hair. Gritty ice sprayed into her eyes, 
blinding her, but then the key turned and she jerked the door open. 


Safe! She slammed the door shut again and brought her fist down on the lock. 
Then she flung herself across the seat to check the locks on the other side. 


The wind roared with a thousand voices outside. The car began rocking. 


"Stop it! Damon, stop it!" Her thin cry was lost in the cacophony. She put her 
hands out on the dashboard as if to balance the car and it rocked harder, ice pelting 
against it. 


Then she saw something. The rear window was clouding up, but she could 
discern the shape through it. It looked like some great bird made of mist or snow, 
but the outlines were hazy. All she was sure of was that it had huge sweeping wings 
... and that it was coming for her. 


Get the key in the ignition. Get it in! Now go! Her mind was rapping orders at her. 
The ancient Ford wheezed and the tires screamed louder than the wind as she took 
off. And the shape behind her followed, getting larger and larger in the rearview 
mirror. 


Get to town, get to Stefan! Go! Go! But as she squealed onto Old Creek Road, 
turning left, the wheels locking, a bolt of lightning split the sky. 


If she hadn't been skidding and braking already, the tree would have crashed 
down on her. As it was, the violent impact shook the car like an earthquake missing 
the front right fender by inches. The tree was a mass of heaving, pitching branches, 
its trunk blocking the way back to town completely. 


She was trapped. Her only route home cut off. She was alone, there was no 
escape from this terrible Power... 


Power. That was it; that was the key. "The stronger your Powers are, the more 
the rules of the dark bind you." 


Running water! 


Throwing the car into reverse, she brought it around and then slammed into 
forward. The white shape banked and swooped, missing her as narrowly as the tree

had, and then she was speeding down Old Creek Road into the worst of the storm. 


There were more cracks of lightning, and she glimpsed other trees falling, but she 


12 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
swerved around them. It couldn't be far now. She could see the river flickering past 
on her left side through the driving ice storm. Then she saw the bridge. 

It was there; she'd made it! A gust threw sleet across the windshield, but with the 
wipers' next stroke she saw it fleetingly again. This was it, the turn should be about 
here. 

The car lurched and skidded onto the wooden structure. Elena felt the wheels grip 
at slick planks and then felt them lock. Desperately, she tried to turn with the skid, 
but she couldn't see and there was no room... 

And then she was crashing through the guardrail, the rotted wood of the 
footbridge giving way under weight it could no longer support. There was a 
sickening feeling of spinning, dropping, and the car hit the water. 

Elena heard screams, but they didn't seem to be connected with her. The river 
welled up around her and everything was noise and confusion and pain. A window 
shattered as it was struck by debris, and then another. Dark water gushed across her, 
along with glass like ice. She was engulfed. She couldn't see; she couldn't get out. 

And she couldn't breathe. She was lost in this hellish tumult, and there was no air. 
She had to breathe. She had to get out of here... 

"Stefan, help me!" she screamed. 

But her scream made no sound. Instead, the icy water rushed into her lungs, 
invading her. She thrashed against it, but it was too strong for her. Her struggles 
became wilder, more uncoordinated, and then they stopped. 

Then everything was still. 

Bonnie and Meredith were hunting around the perimeter of the school impatiently. 
They'd seen Stefan go this way, more or less coerced by Tyler and his new friends. 
They'd started to follow him, but then that business with Elena had started. And then 
Matt had informed them that she'd taken off. So they'd set out after Stefan again, but 
nobody was out here. There weren't even any buildings except one lonely Quonset 
hut. 

"And now there's a storm coming!" Meredith said. "Listen to that wind! I think 
it's going to rain." 

"Or snow!" Bonnie shuddered. "Where did they go?" 

"I don't care; I just want to get under a roof. Here it comes!" Meredith gasped as 
the first sheet of icy rain hit her, and she and Bonnie ran for the nearest shelter-the 
Quonset hut. 


And it was there that they found Stefan. The door was ajar, and when Bonnie 
looked in she recoiled.

And it was there that they found Stefan. The door was ajar, and when Bonnie 
looked in she recoiled. 

Stefan had a semicircle of guys between him and the door. Caroline was in the 
corner. 

"He must have it! He took it somehow; I know he did!" she was saying. 

"Took what?" said Meredith, loudly. Everyone turned their way. 

Caroline's face contorted as she saw them in the doorway and Tyler snarled. "Get 
out." he said. "You don't want to be involved in this." 

Meredith ignored him. "Stefan, can I talk to you?" 

"In a minute. Are you going to answer her question? Took what?" Stefan was 
concentrating on Tyler, totally focused. 

"Sure, I'll answer her question. Right after I answer yours." Tyler's beefy hand 
thumped into his fist and he stepped forward. "You're going to be dog meat, 
Salvatore." 

Several of the tough guys snickered. 

Bonnie opened her mouth to say, "Let's get out of here." But what she actually 
said was, "The bridge." 

It was weird enough to make everyone look at her. 

"What?" said Stefan. 

"The bridge," said Bonnie again, without meaning to say it. Her eyes bulged, 
alarmed. She could hear the voice coming from her throat, but she had no control 
over it. And then she felt her eyes go wider and her mouth drop open and she had 
her own voice back. "The bridge, oh, my God, the bridge! That's where Elena is! 
Stefan, we've got to save her... Oh, hurry!" 

"Bonnie, are you sure?" 

"Yes, oh, God... that's where she's gone. She's drowning! Hurry!" Waves of 
thick blackness broke over Bonnie. But she couldn't faint now; they had to get to 
Elena. 

Stefan and Meredith hesitated one minute, and then Stefan was through the goon 
squad, brushing them aside like tissue paper. They sprinted through the field toward 
the parking lot, dragging Bonnie behind. Tyler started after them, but stopped when 
the full force of the wind hit him. 

"Why would she go out in this storm?" Stefan shouted as they sprang into 
Meredith's car. 

14 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
"She was upset; Matt said she took off in his car," Meredith gasped back in the 
comparative quiet of the interior. She pulled out fast and turned into the wind, 
speeding dangerously. "She said she was going to the boarding house." 


"No, she's at the bridge! Meredith, drive faster! Oh, God, we're going to be too 
late!" Tears were running down Bonnie's face. 

"No, she's at the bridge! Meredith, drive faster! Oh, God, we're going to be too 
late!" Tears were running down Bonnie's face. 

Stefan's sharp warning kept Meredith from running into the tree. They piled out 
and were immediately lashed and punished by the wind. 

"It's too big to move! We'll have to walk," Stefan shouted. 

Of course it was too big to move, Bonnie thought, already scrambling through the 
branches. It was a full-grown oak tree. But once on the other side, the icy gale 
whipped all thought out of her head. 

Within minutes she was numb, and the road seemed to go on for hours. They 
tried to run but the wind beat them back. They could scarcely see; if it hadn't been 
for Stefan, they would have gone over the riverbank. Bonnie began to weave 
drunkenly. She was ready to fall to the ground when she heard Stefan shouting up 
ahead. 

Meredith's arm around her tightened, and they broke again into a stumbling run. 
But as they neared the bridge what they saw brought them to a halt. 

"Oh, my God... Elena!" screamed Bonnie. Wickery Bridge was a mass of 
splintered rubble. The guardrail on one side was gone and the planking had given 
way as if a giant fist had smashed it. Beneath, the dark water churned over a 
sickening pile of debris. Part of the debris, entirely underwater except the headlights, 
was Matt's car. 

Meredith was screaming, too, but she was screaming at Stefan. "No! You can't 
go down there!" 

He never even glanced back. He dived from the bank, and the water closed over 
his head. 

Later, Bonnie's memory of the next hour would be mercifully dim. She 
remembered waiting for Stefan while the storm raged endlessly on. She remembered 
that she was almost beyond caring by the time a hunched figure lurched out of the 
water. She remembered feeling no disappointment, only a vast and yawning grief, as 
she saw the limp thing Stefan laid out on the road. 

And she remembered Stefan's face. 

She remembered how he looked as they tried to do something for Elena. Only 
that wasn't really Elena lying there, that was a wax doll with Elena's features. It was 

15 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
nothing that had ever been alive and it certainly wasn't alive now. Bonnie thought it 
seemed silly to go on poking and prodding at it like this, trying to get water out of its 
lungs and so on. Wax dolls didn't breathe. 


She remembered Stefan's face when he finally gave up. When Meredith wrestled 
with him and yelled at him, saying something about over an hour without air, and 
brain damage. The words filtered in to Bonnie, but their meaning didn't. She just 


. 
thought it odd that while Meredith and Stefan were screaming at each other they were 
both crying. 


thought it odd that while Meredith and Stefan were screaming at each other they were 


both crying. 
And then something seared through Bonnie, bringing her to life, waking her to 
terror. She clutched at Meredith and stared around for the source. Something bad... 
something terrible was coming. Was almost here. 


Stefan seemed to feel it, too. He was alert, stiff, like a wolf picking up a scent. 
"What is it?" shouted Meredith. "What's wrong with you?" 
"You've got to go!" Stefan rose, still holding the limp form in his arms. "Get out 
of here!" 
"What do you mean? We can't leave you-
"Yes, you can! Get out of here! Bonnie, get her out!" 
No one had ever told Bonnie to take care of someone else before. People were 


always taking care of her. But now she seized Meredith's arm and began pulling. 
Stefan was right. There was nothing they could do for Elena, and if they stayed 
whatever had gotten her would get them. 

"Stefan!" Meredith shouted as she was unaccountably dragged away. 
"I'll put her under the trees. The willows, not the oaks," he called after them. 
Why would he tell us that now? Bonnie wondered in some deep part of her mind 
that was not taken up with fear and the storm. 
The answer was simple, and her mind promptly gave it back to her. Because he 


wasn't going to be around to tell them later.

L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
Long ago, in the dark side streets of Florence, starving, frightened, and 
exhausted, Stefan had made himself a vow. Several vows, in fact, about using the 
Powers he sensed within himself, and about how to treat the weak, blundering, but 
still-human creatures around him. 

Now he was going to break them all. 

He'd kissed Elena's cold forehead and laid her under a willow tree. He would 
come back here, if he could, to join her, after. 

As he'd thought, the surge of Power had passed over Bonnie and Meredith and 
followed him, but it had receded again, and was now drawn back, waiting. 

He wouldn't let it wait long. 

Unencumbered by the burden of Elena's body, he broke into a predator's lope on 
the empty road. The freezing sleet and wind didn't bother him much. His hunter's 
senses pierced through them. 

He turned them all to the task of locating the prey he wanted. No thinking of Elena 
now. Later, when this was over. 

Tyler and his friends were still in the Quonset hut. Good. They never knew what 
was coming as the window burst into flying glass shards and the storm blew inside. 

Stefan meant to kill when he seized Tyler by the neck and sank his fangs in. That 
had been one of his rules, not to kill, and he wanted to break it. 

But another of the toughs came at him before he had quite drained Tyler of blood. 
The guy wasn't trying to protect his fallen leader, only to escape. It was his bad luck 
that his route took him across Stefan's path. Stefan flipped him to the ground and 
tapped the new vein eagerly. 

The hot coppery taste revived him, warmed him, flowed through him like fire. It 
made him want more. 

Power. Life. They had it; he needed it. With the glorious rush of strength that 
came with what he'd already drunk, he stunned them easily. Then he moved from 
one to another, drinking deep and throwing them away. It was like popping tops on a 
six-pack. 

He was on the last when he saw Caroline huddling in the corner. 

His mouth was dripping as he raised his head to look at her. Those green eyes, 
usually so narrow, showed white all around like those of a terrified horse. Her lips 
were pale blurs as she gabbled soundless pleas. 

He pulled her to her feet by the green sashes at her waist. She was moaning, her 
eyes rolling up in their sockets. He wound his hand in her auburn hair to position the 
exposed throat where he wanted it. His head reared back to strike-and Caroline 
screamed and went limp. 

17 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 

He dropped her. He'd had enough anyway. He was bursting with blood, like an 
overfed tick. He had never felt so strong, so charged with elemental power. 

He dropped her. He'd had enough anyway. He was bursting with blood, like an 
overfed tick. He had never felt so strong, so charged with elemental power. 

He went out of the Quonset hut the same way he'd come in. But not in human 
form. A hunting falcon soared out the window and wheeled into the sky. 

The new shape was wonderful. Strong... and cruel. And its eyes were sharp. It 
took him where he wanted, skimming over the oak trees of the woods. He was 
looking for a particular clearing. 

He found it. Wind slashed at him but he spiraled downward, with a keening 
scream of challenge. Damon, in human form below, threw up his hands to protect 
his face as the falcon dived at him. 

Stefan ripped bloody strips out of his arms and heard Damon's answering scream 
of pain and anger. 

I'm not your weak little brother any more. He sent the thought down to Damon 
on a stunning blast of Power. And this time I've come for your blood. 

He felt the backwash of hatred from Damon, but the voice in his mind was 
mocking. So this is the thanks I get for saving you and your betrothed? 

Stefan's wings folded and he dived again, his whole world narrowed to one 
objective. Killing. He went for Damon's eyes, and the stick Damon had picked up 
whistled past his new body. His talons tore into Damon's cheek and Damon's blood 
ran. Good. 

You shouldn't have left me alive, he told Damon. You should have killed both of 
us at once. 

I'll be glad to correct the mistake! Damon had been unprepared before, but now 
Stefan could feel his drawing Power, arming himself, standing ready. But first you 
might tell me whom I'm supposed to have killed this time. 

The falcon's brain could not deal with the riot of emotions the taunting question 
called up. Screaming wordlessly, it plummeted on Damon again, but this time the 
heavy stick struck home. Injured, one wing hanging, the falcon dropped behind 
Damon's back. 

Stefan changed to his own form at once, scarcely feeling the pain of his broken 
arm. Before Damon could turn, he grabbed him, the fingers of his good hand digging 
into his brother's neck and spinning him around. 

When he spoke, it was almost gently. 

18 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
"Elena," he said, whispered, and went for Damon's throat. 
It was dark, and very cold, and someone was hurt. Someone needed help. 
But she was terribly tired. 
Elena's eyelids fluttered and opened and that took care of the darkness. As for the 
. 


cold... she was bone-cold, freezing, chilled to the marrow. And no wonder; there 


was ice all over her. 
cold... she was bone-cold, freezing, chilled to the marrow. And no wonder; there 
was ice all over her. 


What had happened? She'd been at home, asleep-no, this was Founders' Day. 
She'd been in the cafeteria, on the stage. 


Someone's face had looked funny. 
It was too much to cope with; she couldn't think. Disembodied faces floated 
before her eyes, fragments of sentences sounded in her ears. She was very 
confused. 


And so tired. 


Better go back to sleep then. The ice wasn't really that bad. She started to lie 
down, and then the cries came to her again. 
She heard them, not with her ears, but with her mind. Cries of anger and of pain. 
Someone was very unhappy. 
She sat quite still, trying to sort it all out. 
There was a quiver of movement at the edge of her vision. A squirrel. She could 


smell it, which was strange because she'd never smelled a squirrel before. It stared at 
her with one bright black eye and then it scampered up the willow tree. Elena realized 
she'd made a grab for it only when she came up empty with her fingernails digging 
into bark. 

Now that was ridiculous. What on earth did she want a squirrel for? She puzzled 
over it for a minute, then lay back down, exhausted. 

The cries were still going on. 
She tried to cover her ears, but that did nothing to block them out. Someone was 
hurt, and unhappy, and fighting. That was it. There was a fight going on. 


All right. She'd figured it out. Now she could sleep. 


19 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 02 - The Struggle 
She couldn't, though. The cries beckoned to her, drew her toward them. She felt 
an irresistible need to follow them to their source. 

And then she could go to sleep. After she saw... him. 
Oh, yes, it was coming back now. She remembered him. He was the one who 
understood her, who loved her. He was the one she wanted to be with forever. 


His face appeared out of the mists in her mind. She considered it lovingly. All 
right, then. For him she would get up and walk through this ridiculous sleet until she 
found the proper clearing. Until she could join him. Then they'd be together. 

The very thought of him seemed to warm her. There was a fire inside him that few 

people could see. She saw it, though. It was like the fire inside her. 
He seemed to be having some sort of trouble at the moment. At least, there was a 
lot of shouting. She was close enough to hear it with her ears as well as her mind 


. 
now. 
now. 
Shaking ice crystals out of her hair, Elena stepped into the clearing in the wood.

The Fury 


One 

Elena stepped into the clearing. 

Beneath her feet tatters of autumn leaves were freezing into the slush. Dusk had 
fallen, and although the storm was dying away the woods were getting colder. Elena 
didn't feel the cold. 

Neither did she mind the dark. Her pupils opened wide, gathering up tiny particles 
of light that would have been invisible to a human. She could see the two figures 
struggling beneath the great oak tree quite clearly. 

One had thick dark hair, which the wind had churned into a tumbled sea of waves. 
He was slightly taller than the other, and although Elena couldn't see his face she 
somehow knew his eyes were green. 

The other had a shock of dark hair as well, but his was fine and straight, almost 
like the pelt of an animal. His lips were drawn back from his teeth in fury, and the 
lounging grace of his body was gathered into a predator's crouch. His eyes were 
black. 

Page 2 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
Elena watched them for several minutes without moving. She'd forgotten why she 
had come here, why she'd been pulled here by the echoes of their battle in her mind. 
This close the clamor of their anger and hatred and pain was almost deafening, like 
silent shouts coming from the fighters. They were locked in a death match. 

I wonder which of them will win, she thought. They were both wounded and 
bleeding, and the taller one's left arm hung at an unnatural angle. Still, he had just 
slammed the other against the gnarled trunk of an oak tree. His fury was so strong 
that Elena could feel and taste it as well as hear it, and she knew it was giving him 
impossible strength. 

And then Elena remembered why she had come. How could she have forgotten? 
He was hurt. His mind had summoned her here, battering her with shock waves of 
rage and pain. She had come to help him because she belonged to him. 

The two figures were down on the icy ground now, righting like wolves, snarling. 
Swiftly and silently Elena went to them. The one with the wavy hair and green eyes-
Stefan, a voice in her mind whispered-was on top, fingers scrabbling at the other's 
throat. Anger washed through Elena, anger and protectiveness. She reached between 
the two of them to grab that choking hand, to pry the fingers up. 

It didn't occur to her that she shouldn't be strong enough to do this. She was 
strong enough; that was all. She threw her weight to the side, wrenching her captive 
away from his opponent. For good measure, she bore down hard on his wounded 
arm, knocking him flat on his face in the leaf-strewn slush. Then she began to choke 
him from behind. 


Her attack had taken him by surprise, but he was far from beaten. He struck back 
at her, his good hand fumbling for her throat. His thumb dug into her windpipe. 

Her attack had taken him by surprise, but he was far from beaten. He struck back 
at her, his good hand fumbling for her throat. His thumb dug into her windpipe. 

But he was stronger than she was. With a jerk of his shoulders, he broke her hold 
on him and twisted in her grasp, flinging her down. And then he was above her, his 
face contorted with animal fury. She hissed at him and went for his eyes with her 
nails, but he knocked her hand away. 

He was going to kill her. Even wounded, he was by far the stronger. His lips had 
drawn back to show teeth already stained with scarlet. Like a cobra, he was ready to 
strike. 

Then he stopped, hovering over her, his face changing. 

Elena saw the green eyes widen. The pupils, which had been contracted to vicious 
dots, sprang open. He was staring down at her as if truly seeing her for the first time. 

Why was he looking at her that way? Why didn't he just get it over with? But now 
the iron hand on her shoulder was releasing her. The animal snarl had disappeared, 

Page 3 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
replaced by a look of bewilderment and wonder. He sat back, helping her to sit up, 
all the while gazing into her face. 
"Elena," he whispered. His voice was cracked. "Elena, it's you." 


Is that who I am? she thought. Elena? 
It didn't really matter. She cast a glance toward the old oak tree. He was still there, 
standing between the upthrust roots, panting, supporting himself against it with one 
hand. He was looking at her with his endlessly black eyes, his brows drawn together 
in a frown. 


Don't worry, she thought. I can take care of this one. He's stupid. Then she flung 


herself on the green-eyed one again. 
"Elena!" he cried as she knocked him backward. His good hand pushed at her 
shoulder, holding her up. "Elena, it's me, Stefan! Elena, look at me!" 


She was looking. All she could see was the exposed patch of skin at his neck. 
She hissed again, upper lip drawing back, showing him her teeth. 

He froze. 
She felt the shock reverberate through his body, saw his gaze shatter. His face 
went as white as if someone had struck him a blow in the stomach. He shook his 
head slightly on the muddy ground. 


"No," he whispered. "Oh, no..." 


He seemed to be saying it to himself, as if he didn't expect her to hear him. He 
reached a hand toward her cheek, and she snapped at it. 
"Oh, Elena..." he whispered. 
. 


The last traces of fury, of animal bloodlust, had disappeared from his face. His 


eyes were dazed and stricken and grieving. 
The last traces of fury, of animal bloodlust, had disappeared from his face. His 
eyes were dazed and stricken and grieving. 


He stared at her a moment, the pain in his eyes reaching a peak, and then he 


simply gave up. He stopped fighting completely. 
She could feel it happen, feel the resistance leave his body. He lay on the icy 
ground with scraps of oak leaves in his hair, staring up past her at the black and 
clouded sky. 


Finish it, his weary voice said in her mind. 
Elena hesitated for an instant. There was something about those eyes that called 


Page 4 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
up memories inside her. Standing in the moonlight, sitting in an attic room... But the 
memories were too vague. She couldn't get a grasp on them, and the effort made her 
dizzy and sick. 


And this one had to die, this green-eyed one called Stefan. Because he'd hurt him, 
the other one, the one Elena had been born to be with. No one could hurt him and 
live. 


She clamped her teeth into his throat and bit deep. 


She realized at once that she wasn't doing it quite right. She hadn't hit an artery or 
vein. She worried at the throat, angry at her own inexperience. It felt good to bite 
something, but not much blood was coming. Frustrated, she lifted up and bit again, 
feeling his body jerk in pain. 


Much better. She'd found a vein this time, but she hadn't torn it deeply enough. A 
little scratch like that wouldn't do. What she needed was to rip it right across, to let 
the rich hot blood stream out. 


Her victim shuddered as she worked to do this, teeth raking and gnawing. She 
was just feeling the flesh give way when hands pulled at her, lifting her from behind. 


Elena snarled without letting go of the throat. The hands were insistent though. An 
arm looped about her waist, fingers twined in her hair. She fought, clinging with teeth 
and nails to her prey. 


Let go of him. Leave him! 


The voice was sharp and commanding, like a blast from a cold wind. Elena 
recognized it and stopped struggling with the hands that pulled her away. As they 
deposited her on the ground and she looked up to see him, a name came into her 
mind. Damon. His name was Damon. She stared at him sulkily, resentful of being 
yanked away from her kill, but obedient. 


Stefan was sitting up, his neck red with blood. It was running onto his shirt. Elena 
licked her lips, feeling a throb like a hunger pang that seemed to come from every 
fiber of her being. She was dizzy again. 


. 
"I thought," Damon said aloud, "that you said she was dead." 
He was looking at Stefan, who was even paler than before, if that was possible. 


That white face filled with infinite hopelessness. 


"Look at her" was all he said. 


A hand cupped Elena's chin, tilting her face up. She met Damon's narrowed dark 
eyes directly. Then long, slender fingers touched her lips, probing between them. 
Instinctively Elena tried to bite, but not very hard. Damon's finger found the sharp 
curve of a canine tooth, and Elena did bite now, giving it a nip like a kitten's. 


Page 5 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
Damon's face was expressionless, his eyes hard. 
"Do you know where you are?" he said. 
Elena glanced around. Trees. "In the woods," she said craftily, looking back at 
him. 
"And who is that?" 
She followed his pointing finger. "Stefan," she said indifferently. "Your brother." 
"And who am I? Do you know who I am?" She smiled up at him, showing him 
her pointed teeth. "Of course I do. You're Damon, and I love you." 
. 


Two 


Stefan's voice was quietly savage. "That's what you wanted, wasn't it, Damon? 
And now you've got it. You had to make her like us, like you. It wasn't enough just 
to kill her." 

Damon didn't glance back at him. He was looking at Elena intently through those 
hooded eyes, still kneeling there holding her chin. "That's the third time you've said 
that, and I'm getting a little tired of it," he commented softly. Disheveled, still slightly 
out of breath, he was yet self-composed, in control. "Elena, did I kill you?" 

"Of course not," Elena said, winding her fingers in those of his free hand. She 
was getting impatient. What were they talking about anyway? Nobody had been 
killed. 

"I never thought you were a liar," Stefan said to Damon, the bitterness in his voice 
unchanged. "Just about everything else, but not that. I've never heard you try to 
cover up for yourself before." 

"In another minute," said Damon, "I'm going to lose my temper." 

What more can you possibly do to me? Stefan returned. Killing me would be a 
mercy. 

"I ran out of mercy for you a century ago," Damon said aloud. He let go, finally, 
of Elena's chin. "What do you remember about today?" he asked her. 

Elena spoke tiredly, like a child reciting a hated lesson. "Today was the Founders' 
Day celebration." Flexing her fingers in his, she looked up at Damon. That was as far 
as she could get on her own, but it wasn't enough. Nettled, she tried to remember 
something else. 

Page 6 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
"There was someone in the cafeteria... Caroline." She offered the name to him, 
pleased. "She was going to read my diary in front of everyone, and that was bad 
because..." Elena fumbled with the memory and lost it. "I don't remember why. But 
we tricked her." She smiled at him warmly, conspiratorially. 


"Oh, 'we' did, did we?" 


"Yes. You got it away from her. You did it for me." The fingers of her free hand 
crept under his jacket, searching for the square-cornered hardness of the little book. 
"Because you love me," she said, finding it and scratching at it lightly. "You do love 
me, don't you?" 


There was a faint sound from the center of the clearing. Elena looked and saw that 
Stefan had turned his face away. 


"Elena. What happened next?" Damon's voice called her back. 


"Next? Next Aunt Judith started arguing with me." Elena pondered this a moment 
and at last shrugged. "Over... something. I got angry. She's not my mother. She 
can't tell me what to do." 


. 
Damon's voice was dry. "I don't think that's going to be a problem anymore. 
What next?" 


Damon's voice was dry. "I don't think that's going to be a problem anymore. 
What next?" 


"And where did you go in Matt's car?" 


"To Wickery Bridge," Stefan said, turning back toward them. His eyes were 
desolate. 


"No, to the boardinghouse," Elena corrected, irritated. "To wait for... mm... I 
forget. Anyway, I waited there. Then... then the storm started. Wind, rain, all that. I 
didn't like it. I got in the car. But something came after me." 


"Someone came after you," said Stefan, looking at Damon. 


"Some thing," Elena insisted. She had had enough of his interruptions. "Let's go 
away somewhere, just us," she said to Damon, kneeling up so that her face was 
close to his. 


"In a minute," he said. "What kind of thing came after you?" 


She settled back, exasperated. "I don't know what kind of thing! It was like 
nothing I've ever seen. Not like you and Stefan. It was..." Images rippled through 
her mind. Mist flowing along the ground. The wind shrieking. A shape, white, 
enormous, looking as if it were made out of mist itself. Gaining on her like a 
wind-driven cloud.

"Maybe it was just part of the storm," she said. "But I thought it wanted to hurt 
me. I got away though." Fiddling with the zipper to Damon's leather jacket, she 
smiled secretly and looked up at him through her lashes. 

For the first time, Damon's face showed emotion. His lips twisted in a grimace. 
"You got away." 

"Yes. I remembered what... someone... told me about running water. Evil things 
can't cross it. So I drove toward Drowning Creek, toward the bridge. And then..." 
She hesitated, frowning, trying to find a solid memory in the new confusion. Water. 
She remembered water. And someone screaming. But nothing else. "And then I 
crossed it," she concluded finally, brightly. "I must have, because here I am. And 
that's all. Can we go now?" 

Damon didn't answer her. 

"The car's still in the river," said Stefan. He and Damon were looking at each 
other like two adults having a discussion over the head of an uncomprehending 
child, their hostilities suspended for the moment. Elena felt a surge of annoyance. 
She opened her mouth, but Stefan was continuing. "Bonnie and Meredith and I 
found it. I went underwater and got her, but by then..." 

By then, what? Elena frowned. 

Damon's lips were curved mockingly. "And you gave up on her? You, of all 


people, should have suspected what might happen. Or was the idea so repugnant to 
you that you couldn't even consider it? Would you rather she were really dead?" 

people, should have suspected what might happen. Or was the idea so repugnant to 
you that you couldn't even consider it? Would you rather she were really dead?" 

Elena opened her mouth again, but Damon laid two fingers on it to keep her quiet. 
He said smoothly, "And that's the problem now-or are you too blind to see that, 
too? You told me to look at her; look at her yourself. She's in shock, irrational. Oh, 
yes, even I admit that." He paused for a blinding smile before going on. "It's more 
than just the normal confusion after changing. She'll need blood, human blood, or 
her body won't have the strength to finish the change. She'll die." 

What do you mean irrational? Elena thought indignantly. "I'm fine," she said 
around Damon's fingers. "I'm tired, that's all. I was going to sleep when I heard you 
two fighting, and I came to help you. And then you wouldn't even let me kill him," 
she finished, disgusted. 

"Yes, why didn't you?" said Stefan. He was staring at Damon as if he could bore 
holes through him with his eyes. Any trace of cooperation on his part was gone. "It 
would have been the easiest thing to do." 

Damon stared back at him, suddenly furious, his own animosity flooding up to 
meet Stefan's. He was breathing quickly and lightly. "Maybe I don't like things easy," 

Page 8 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
he hissed. Then he seemed to regain control of himself once more. His lips curled in 
mockery, and he added, "Put it this way, dear brother: if anyone's going to have the 
satisfaction of killing you, it will be me. No one else. I plan to take care of the job 
personally. And it's something I'm very good at; I promise you." 


"You've shown us that," Stefan said quietly, as if each word sickened him. 


"But this one," Damon said, turning to Elena with glittering eyes, "I didn't kill. 
Why should I? I could have changed her any time I liked." 


"Maybe because she had just gotten engaged to marry someone else." 


Damon lifted Elena's hand, still twined with his. On the third finger a gold ring 
glittered, set with one deep blue stone. Elena frowned at it, vaguely remembering 
having seen it before. Then she shrugged and leaned against Damon wearily. 


"Well, now," Damon said, looking down at her, "that doesn't seem to be much of 
a problem, does it? I think she may have been glad to forget you." He looked up at 
Stefan with an unpleasant smile. "But we'll find out once she's herself again. We can 
ask her then which of us she chooses. Agreed?" 


Stefan shook his head. "How can you even suggest that? After what happened..." 
His voice trailed off. 


"With Katherine? I can say it, if you can't. Katherine made a foolish choice, and 
she paid the price for it. Elena is different; she knows her own mind. But it doesn't 
matter if you agree," he added, overriding Stefan's new protests. "The fact is that 
she's weak now, and she needs blood. I'm going to see that she gets it, and then I'm 
going to find who did this to her. You can come or not. Suit yourself." 


. 
He stood, drawing Elena up with him. Let's go. 


He stood, drawing Elena up with him. Let's go. 


She recognized the place where they left the wood. She had been there earlier 
today. Now, however, there was some sort of frenzied activity going on: red and 
blue lights flashing on cars, spotlights framing the dark huddled shapes of people. 
Elena looked at them curiously. Several were familiar. That woman, for instance, 
with the thin harrowed face and the anxious eyes-Aunt Judith? And the tall man 
beside her-Aunt Judith's fianc.., Robert? 


There should be someone else with them, Elena thought. A child with hair as pale 
as Elena's own. But try as she might, she could not conjure up a name. 


The two girls with their arms around each other, standing in a circle of officials, 
those two she remembered though. The little red-haired one who was crying was 
Bonnie. The taller one with the sweep of dark hair, Meredith. 


"But she's not in the water," Bonnie was saying to a man in a uniform. Her voice 
trembled on the edge of hysteria. "We saw Stefan get her out. I've told you and told 


Page 9 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
you." 
"And you left him here with her?" 
"We had to. The storm was getting worse, and there was something coming-" 
"Never mind that," Meredith broke in. She sounded only slightly calmer than 


Bonnie. "Stefan said that if he-had to leave her, he'd leave her lying under the 
willow trees." 


"And just where is Stefan now?" another uniformed man asked. 
"We don't know. We went back to get help. He probably followed us. But as for 
what happened to-to Elena..." Bonnie turned back and buried her face in 
Meredith's shoulder. 


They're upset about me, Elena realized. How silly of them. I can clear that up, 
anyway. She started forward into the light, but Damon pulled her back. She looked 
at him, wounded. 


"Not like that. Pick the ones you want, and we'll draw them out," he said. 
"Want for what?" 
"For feeding, Elena. You're a hunter now. Those are your prey." 
Elena pushed her tongue against a canine tooth doubtfully. Nothing out there 


looked like food to her. Still, because Damon said so, she was inclined to give him 


the benefit of the doubt. "Whichever you think," she said obligingly. 
. 
Damon tilted his head back, eyes narrowed, scanning the scene like an expert 
evaluating a famous painting. "Well, how about a couple of nice paramedics?" 


Damon tilted his head back, eyes narrowed, scanning the scene like an expert 
evaluating a famous painting. "Well, how about a couple of nice paramedics?" 


Damon barely glanced over his shoulder at Stefan. "Why not?" 
"Because there've been enough attacks. She may need human blood, but she 
doesn't have to hunt for it." Stefan's face was shut and hostile, but there was an air 
of grim determination about him. 


"There's another way?" Damon asked ironically. 
"You know there is. Find someone who's willing-or who can be influenced to 


be willing. Someone who would do it for Elena and who is strong enough to deal 
with this, mentally." 
"And I suppose you know where we can find such a paragon of virtue?"

L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
"Bring her to the school. I'll meet you there," Stefan said, and disappeared. 


They left the activity still bustling, lights flashing, people milling. As they went, 
Elena noticed a strange thing. In the middle of the river, illuminated by the spotlights, 
was an automobile. It was completely submerged except for the front fender, which 
stuck out of the water. 


What a stupid place to park a car, she thought, and followed Damon back into the 
woods. 


Stefan was beginning to feel again. 


It hurt. He'd thought he was through with hurting, through with feeling anything. 
When he'd pulled Elena's lifeless body out of the dark water, he'd thought that 
nothing could ever hurt again because nothing could match that moment. 


He'd been wrong. 


He stopped and stood with his good hand braced against a tree, head down, 
breathing deeply. When the red mists cleared and he could see again, he went on, 
but the burning ache in his chest continued undiminished. Stop thinking about her, he 
told himself, knowing that it was useless. 


But she wasn't truly dead. Didn't that count for something? He'd thought he 
would never hear her voice again, never feel her touch... 


And now, when she touched him, she wanted to kill him. 


He stopped again, doubling over, afraid he was going to be sick. 


Seeing her like this was worse torture than seeing her lying cold and dead. Maybe 
that was why Damon had let him live. Maybe this was Damon's revenge. 


And maybe Stefan should just do what he'd planned to do after killing Damon. 
Wait until dawn and take off the silver ring that protected him from sunlight. Stand 
bathing in the fiery embrace of those rays until they burned the flesh from his bones 


. 
and stopped the pain once and for all. 


and stopped the pain once and for all. 


Stefan detoured toward the boardinghouse. He needed to clean up before he 
could let humans see him. In his room, he washed the blood from his face and neck 
and examined his arm. The healing process had already begun, and with 
concentration he could accelerate it still further. He was burning up his Powers fast; 
the fight with his brother had already weakened him. But this was important. Not 
because of the pain-he scarcely noticed that-but because he needed to be fit. 


Damon and Elena were waiting outside the school. He could feel his brother's 
impatience and Elena's wild new presence there in the dark.

L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
"This had better work," Damon said. 
Stefan said nothing. The school auditorium was another center of commotion. 
People ought to have been enjoying the Founders' Day dance; in fact, those who had 


remained through the storm were pacing around or gathered in small groups talking. 
Stefan looked in the open door, searching with his mind for one particular presence. 
He found it. A blond head was bent over a table in the corner. 
Matt. 
Matt straightened and looked around, puzzled. Stefan willed him to come outside. 


You need some fresh air, he thought, insinuating the suggestion into Matt's 


subconscious. You feel like just stepping out for a moment. 
To Damon, standing invisible just beyond the light, he said, Take her into the 
school, to the photography room. She knows where it is. Don't show yourselves 
until I say. Then he backed away and waited for Matt to appear. 


Matt came out, his drawn face turned up to the moonless sky. He started violently 


when Stefan spoke to him. 
"Stefan! You're here!" Desperation, hope, and horror struggled for dominance on 
his face. He hurried over to Stefan. "Did they-bring her back yet? Is there any 
news?" 


"What have you heard?" 
Matt stared at him a moment before answering. "Bonnie and Meredith came in 


saying that Elena had gone off of Wickery Bridge in my car. They said that she..." 
He paused and swallowed. "Stefan, it's not true, is it?" His eyes were pleading. 
Stefan looked away. 
"Oh, God," Matt said hoarsely. He turned his back on Stefan, pressing the heels 


of his hands into his eyes. "I don't believe it; I don't. It can't be true." 
"Matt..." He touched the other boy's shoulder. 
"I'm sorry." Matt's voice was rough and ragged. "You must be going through

hell, and here I am making it worse." 
hell, and here I am making it worse." 
His only other option was to tell Matt the truth. Let Matt make his own choice, 


knowing everything. 
"If there were something you could do for Elena right now," he said, "would you

L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
do it?" 

Matt was too lost in emotion to ask what kind of idiotic question that was. 
"Anything," he said almost angrily, rubbing a sleeve over his eyes. "I'd do anything 
for her." He looked at Stefan with something like defiance, his breathing shaky. 

Congratulations', Stefan thought, feeling the sudden yawning pit in his stomach. 
You've just won yourself a trip to the Twilight Zone. 

"Come with me," he said. "I've got something to show you."

Elena and Damon were waiting in the darkroom. Stefan could sense their presence 
in the small annex as he pushed the door to the photography room open and led 
Matt inside. 

"These doors are supposed to be locked," Matt said as Stefan flipped on the light 
switch. 

"They were," said Stefan. He didn't know what else to say to prepare Matt for 
what was coming. He'd never deliberately revealed himself to a human before. 

He stood, quietly, until Matt turned and looked at him. The classroom was cold 
and silent, and the air seemed to hang heavily. As the moment stretched out, he saw 
Matt's expression slowly change from grief-numbed bewilderment to uneasiness. 

"I don't understand," Matt said. 

"I know you don't." He went on looking at Matt, purposefully dropping the 
barriers that concealed his Powers from human perception. He saw the reaction in 
Matt's face as uneasiness coalesced into fear. Matt blinked and shook his head, his 
breath coming quicker. 

"What-?" he began, his voice gravelly. 

"There are probably a lot of things you've wondered about me," Stefan said. 
"Why I wear sunglasses in strong light. Why I don't eat. Why my reflexes are so 
fast." 

Matt had his back to the darkroom now. His throat jerked as if he were trying to 
swallow. Stefan, with his predator's senses, could hear Matt's heart thudding dully. 

"No," Matt said. 

"You must have wondered, must have asked yourself what makes me so different 
from everybody else." 

"No. I mean-I don't care. I keep out of things that aren't my business." Matt was

L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
edging toward the door, his eyes darting toward it in a barely perceptible movement. 

"Don't, Matt. I don't want to hurt you, but I can't let you leave now." He could 
feel barely leashed need emanating from Elena in her concealment. Wait, he told her. 

Matt went still, giving up any attempt to move away. "If you want to scare me, 
you have," he said in a low voice. "What else do you want?" 

Now, Stefan told Elena. He said to Matt, "Turn around." 

Matt turned. And stifled a cry. 

Elena stood there, but not the Elena of that afternoon, when Matt had last seen 
her. Now her feet were bare beneath the hem of her long dress. The thin folds of 
white muslin that clung to her were caked with ice crystals that sparkled in the light. 
Her skin, always fair, had a strange wintry luster to it, and her pale gold hair seemed 


overlaid with a silvery sheen. But the real difference was in her face. Those deep blue 
eyes were heavy-lidded, almost sleepy looking, and yet unnaturally awake. And a 
look of sensual anticipation and hunger curled about her lips. She was more beautiful 
than she had been in life, but it was a frightening beauty. 

overlaid with a silvery sheen. But the real difference was in her face. Those deep blue 
eyes were heavy-lidded, almost sleepy looking, and yet unnaturally awake. And a 
look of sensual anticipation and hunger curled about her lips. She was more beautiful 
than she had been in life, but it was a frightening beauty. 

"Matt," she said, lingering over the first consonant of the name. Then she smiled. 

Stefan heard Matt's indrawn breath of disbelief, and the near sob he gave as he 
finally backed away from her. 

It's all right, he said, sending the thought to Matt on a surge of Power. As Matt 
jerked toward him, eyes wide with shock, he added, "So now you know." 

Matt's expression said that he didn't want to know, and Stefan could see the 
denial in his face. But Damon stepped out beside Elena and moved a little to the 
right, adding his presence to the charged atmosphere of the room. 

Matt was surrounded. The three of them closed in on him, inhumanly beautiful, 
innately menacing. 

Stefan could smell Matt's fear. It was the helpless fear of the rabbit for the fox, 
the mouse for the owl. And Matt was right to be afraid. They were the hunting 
species; he was the hunted. Their job in life was to kill him. 

And just now instincts were getting out of control. Matt's instinct was to panic 
and run, and it was triggering reflexes in Stefan's head. When the prey ran, the 
predator gave chase; it was as simple as that. All three of the predators here were 
keyed up, on edge, and Stefan felt he couldn't be responsible for the consequences

L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
if Matt bolted. 


We don't want to harm you, he told Matt. It's Elena who needs you, and what 
she needs won't leave you permanently damaged. It doesn't even have to hurt, 
Matt. But Matt's muscles were still tensed to flee, and Stefan realized that the three 
of them were stalking him, moving closer, ready to cut off any escape. 


You said you would do anything for Elena, he reminded Matt desperately and 
saw him make his choice. 


Matt released his breath, the tension draining from his body. "You're right; I did," 
he whispered. He visibly braced himself before he continued. "What does she 
need?" 


Elena leaned forward and put a finger on Matt's neck, tracing the yielding ridge of 
an artery. 


"Not that one," Stefan said quickly. "You don't want to kill him. Tell her, 
Damon." He added, when Damon made no effort to do so, Tell her. 


"Try here, or here." Damon pointed with clinical efficiency, holding Matt's chin 
up. He was strong enough that Matt couldn't break the grip, and Stefan felt Matt's 
panic surge up again. 


Trust me, Matt. He moved in behind the human boy. But it has to be your choice, 


. 
he finished, suddenly washed with compassion. You can change your mind. 


he finished, suddenly washed with compassion. You can change your mind. 


"Matt," she whispered, her heavy-lashed jewel blue eyes fixed on his. Then they 
trailed down to his throat and her lips parted hungrily. There was no sign of the 
uncertainty she'd shown when Damon suggested feeding off the paramedics. "Matt." 
She smiled again, and then she struck, swift as a hunting bird. 


Stefan put a flattened hand against Matt's back to give him support. For a 
moment, as Elena's teeth pierced his skin, Matt tried to recoil, but Stefan thought 
swiftly, Don't fight it; that's what causes the pain. 


As Matt tried to relax, unexpected help came from Elena, who was radiating the 
warm happy thoughts of a wolf cub being fed. She had gotten the biting technique 
right on the first try this time, and she was filled with innocent pride and growing 
satisfaction as the sharp pangs of hunger eased. And with appreciation for Matt, 
Stefan realized, with a sudden shock of jealousy. She didn't hate Matt or want to kill 
him, because he posed no threat to Damon. She was fond of Matt. 


Stefan let her take as much as was safe and then intervened. That's enough, 
Elena. You don't want to injure him. But it took the combined efforts of him, 
Damon, and a rather groggy Matt to pry her off. 


5 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
"She needs to rest now," Damon said. "I'm taking her someplace where she can 
do it safely." He wasn't asking Stefan; he was telling him. 


As they left, his mental voice added, for Stefan's ears alone, I haven't forgotten 
the way you attacked me, brother. We'll talk about that later. 


Stefan stared after them. He'd noted how Elena's eyes remained locked on 
Damon, how she followed him without question. But she was out of danger now; 
Matt's blood had given her the strength she needed. That was all Stefan had to hang 
on to, and he told himself it was all that mattered. 


He turned to take in Matt's dazed expression. The human boy had sunk into one 
of the plastic chairs and was gazing straight ahead. 


Then his eyes lifted to Stefan's, and they regarded each other grimly. 


"So," Matt said. "Now I know." He shook his head, turning away slightly. "But I 
still can't believe it," he muttered. His fingers pressed gingerly at the side of his neck, 
and he winced. "Except for this." Then he frowned. "That guy-Damon. Who is 
he?" 


"My older brother," Stefan said without emotion. "How do you know his name?" 


"He was at Elena's house last week. The kitten spat at him." Matt paused, clearly 
remembering something else. "And Bonnie had some kind of psychic fit." 


"She had a precognition? What did she say? 


"She said-she said that Death was in the house." 


. 
Stefan looked at the door Damon and Elena had passed through. "She was right." 


Stefan looked at the door Damon and Elena had passed through. "She was right." 


"Be like what?" Stefan said brutally. "Disoriented? A vampire?" 


Matt looked away. "Both." 


"As for the first, she may become more rational now that she's fed. That's what 
Damon thinks anyway. As for the other, there's only one thing you can do to change 
her condition." As Matt's eyes lit with hope, Stefan continued. "You can get a 
wooden stake and hammer it through her heart. Then she won't be a vampire 
anymore. She'll just be dead." 


Matt got up and went to the window. 


"You wouldn't be killing her, though, because that's already been done. She 
drowned in the river, Matt. But because she'd had enough blood from me"-he 
paused to steady his voice-"and, it seems, from my brother, she changed instead 
of simply dying. She woke up a hunter, like us. That's what she'll be from now on."

L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
With his back still turned, Matt answered. "I always knew there was something 
about you. I told myself it was just because you were from another country." He 
shook his head again self-deprecatingly. "But deep down I knew it was more than 
that. And something still kept telling me I could trust you, and I did." 


"Like when you went with me to get the vervain." 


"Yeah. Like that." He added, "Can you tell me what the hell it was for, now?" 


"For Elena's protection. I wanted to keep Damon away from her. But it looks as if 
that's not what she wanted after all." He couldn't help the bitterness, the raw betrayal, 
in his voice. 


Matt turned. "Don't judge her before you know all the facts, Stefan. That's one 
thing I've learned." 


Stefan was startled; then, he gave a small humorless smile. As Elena's exes, he 
and Matt were in the same position now. He wondered if he would be as gracious 
about it as Matt had been. Take his defeat like a gentleman. 


He didn't think so. 


Outside, a noise had begun. It was inaudible to human ears, and Stefan almost 
ignored it-until the words penetrated his consciousness. 


Then he remembered what he had done in this very school only a few hours ago. 
Until that moment, he'd forgotten all about Tyler Smallwood and his tough friends. 


Now that memory had returned; shame and horror closed his throat. He'd been 
out of his mind with grief over Elena, and his reason had snapped under the 
pressure. But that was no excuse for what he had done. Were they all dead? Had he, 
who had sworn so long ago never to kill, killed six people today? 


. 
"Stefan, wait. Where are you going?" When he didn't answer, Matt followed him, 
half running to keep up, out of the main school building and onto the blacktop. On 
the far side of the field, Mr. Shelby stood by the Quonset hut. 


"Stefan, wait. Where are you going?" When he didn't answer, Matt followed him, 
half running to keep up, out of the main school building and onto the blacktop. On 
the far side of the field, Mr. Shelby stood by the Quonset hut. 


It looked like the Mad Slasher room from the Haunted House fundraiser. Except 
that this was no tableau set up for visitors. This was real. 


Bodies were sprawled everywhere, amid shards of wood and glass from the 
shattered window. Every visible surface was spattered with blood, red-brown and 
sinister as it dried. And one look at the bodies revealed why: each one had a pair of 
livid purple wounds in the neck. Except Caroline's: her neck was unmarked, but her 
eyes were blank and staring. 


7 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
Behind Stefan, Matt was hyperventilating. "Stefan, Elena didn't-she didn't-" 


"Be quiet," Stefan answered tersely. He glanced back at Mr. Shelby, but the 
janitor had stumbled over to his cart of brooms and mops and was leaning against it. 
Glass grated under Stefan's feet as he crossed the floor to kneel by Tyler. 


Not dead. Relief exploded over Stefan at the realization. Tyler's chest moved 
feebly, and when Stefan lifted the boy's head his eyes opened a slit, glazed and 
unfocused. 


You don't remember anything, Stefan told him mentally. Even as he did it, he 
wondered why he was bothering. He should just leave Fell's Church, cut out now 
and never come back. 


But he wouldn't. Not as long as Elena was here. 


He gathered the unconscious minds of the other victims into his mental grasp and 
told them the same thing, feeding it deep into their brains. You don't remember who 
attacked you. The whole afternoon is a blank. 


As he did, he felt his mental Powers tremble like overfatigued muscles. He was 
close to burnout. 


Outside, Mr. Shelby had found his voice at last and was shouting. Wearily, Stefan 
let Tyler's head slip back through his fingers to the floor and turned around. 


Matt's lips were peeled back, his nostrils flared, as if he had just smelled 
something disgusting. His eyes were the eyes of a stranger. "Elena didn't," he 
whispered. "You did." 


Be quiet! Stefan pushed past him into the thankful coolness of the night, putting 
distance between him and that room, feeling the icy air on his hot skin. Running 
footsteps from the vicinity of the cafeteria told him that some humans had heard the 
janitor's cries at last. 


"You did it, didn't you?" Matt had followed Stefan out to the field. His voice said 
he was trying to understand. 


. 
Stefan rounded on him. "Yes, I did it," he snarled. He stared Matt down, 
concealing none of the angry menace in his face. "I told you, Matt, we're hunters. 
Killers. You're the sheep; we're the wolves. And Tyler has been asking for it every 
day since I came here."

concealing none of the angry menace in his face. "I told you, Matt, we're hunters. 
Killers. You're the sheep; we're the wolves. And Tyler has been asking for it every 
day since I came here." 


"Why should I?" said Stefan coldly, emptily. "Do you regret it when you eat too

L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
much steak? Feel sorry for the cow?" He saw Matt's look of sick disbelief and 
pressed on, driving the pain in his chest deeper. It was better that Matt stay away 
from him from now on, far away. Or Matt might end up like those bodies in the 
Quonset hut. "I am what I am, Matt. And if you can't handle it, you'd better steer 
clear of me." 

Matt stared at him a moment longer, the sick disbelief transforming slowly into 
sick disillusionment. The muscles around his jaw stood out. Then, without a word, 
he turned on his heel and walked away. 

Elena was in the graveyard. 

Damon had left her there, exhorting her to stay until he came back. She didn't 
want to sit still, though. She felt tired but not really sleepy, and the new blood was 
affecting her like a jolt of caffeine. She wanted to go exploring. 

The graveyard was full of activity although there wasn't a human in sight. A fox 
slunk through the shadows toward the river path. Small rodents tunneled under the 
long lank grass around the headstones, squeaking and scurrying. A barn owl flew 
almost silently toward the ruined church, where it alighted on the belfry with an eerie 
cry. 

Elena got up and followed it. This was much better than hiding in the grass like a 
mouse or vole. She looked around the ruined church interestedly, using her 
sharpened senses to examine it. Most of the roof had fallen in, and only three walls 
were standing, but the belfry stood up like a lonely monument in the rubble. 

At one side was the tomb of Thomas and Honoria Fell, like a large stone box or 
coffin. Elena gazed earnestly down into the white marble faces of their statues on the 
lid. They lay in tranquil repose, their eyes shut, their hands folded on their breasts. 
Thomas Fell looked serious and a little stern, but Honoria looked merely sad. Elena 
thought absently of her own parents, lying side by side down in the modern 
cemetery. 

I'll go home; that's where I'll go, she thought. She had just remembered about 
home. She could picture it now: her pretty bedroom with blue curtains and 
cherrywood furniture and her little fireplace. And something important under the 
floorboards in the closet. 

She found her way to Maple Street by instincts that ran deeper than memory, 


letting her feet guide her there. It was an old, old house, with a big front porch and 
floor-to-ceiling windows in front. Robert's car was parked in the driveway. 

letting her feet guide her there. It was an old, old house, with a big front porch and 
floor-to-ceiling windows in front. Robert's car was parked in the driveway. 

But she wasn't going to be able to get in here without being noticed. A woman 
was sitting on the bed with Elena's red silk kimono in her lap, staring down at it. 
Aunt Judith. Robert was standing by the dresser, talking to her. Elena found that she

could pick up the murmur of his voice even through the glass. 


"... out again tomorrow," he was saying. "As long as it doesn't storm. They'll go 
over every inch of those woods, and they'll find her, Judith. You'll see." Aunt Judith 
said nothing, and he went on, sounding more desperate. "We can't give up hope, no 
matter what the girls say-" 


"It's no good, Bob." Aunt Judith had raised her head at last, and her eyes were 
red-rimmed but dry. "It's no use." 


"The rescue effort? I won't have you talking that way." He came over to stand 
beside her. 


"No, not just that... although I know, in my heart, that we're not going to find her 
alive. I mean... everything. Us. What happened today is our fault-" 


"That's not true. It was a freak accident." 


"Yes, but we made it happen. If we hadn't been so harsh with her, she would 
never have driven off alone and been caught in the storm. No, Bob, don't try to shut 
me up; I want you to listen." Aunt Judith took a deep breath and continued. "It 
wasn't just today, either. Elena's been having problems for a long time, ever since 
school started, and somehow I've let the signs slip right past me. Because I've been 
too involved with myself-with us-to pay attention to them. I can see that now. 
And now that Elena's... gone... I don't want the same thing to happen with 
Margaret." 


"What are you saying?" 


"I'm saying that I can't marry you, not as soon as we planned. Maybe not ever." 
Without looking at him, she spoke softly. 


"Margaret has lost too much already. I don't want her to feel she's losing me, 
too." 


"She won't be losing you. If anything, she'll be gaining someone, because I'll be 
here more often. You know how I feel about her." 


"I'm sorry, Bob; I just don't see it that way." 


"You can't be serious. After all the time I've spent here-after all I've done..." 


Aunt Judith's voice was drained and implacable. "I am serious." 


From her perch outside the window, Elena eyed Robert curiously. A vein

throbbed in his forehead, and his face had flushed red. 


throbbed in his forehead, and his face had flushed red.

L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
"No, I won't." 

"You don't mean it-" 

"I do mean it. Don't tell me that I'm going to change my mind, because I'm not." 

For an instant, Robert looked around in helpless frustration; then, his expression 
darkened. When he spoke, his voice was flat and cold. "I see. Well, if that's your 
final answer, I'd better leave right now." 

"Bob." Aunt Judith turned, startled, but he was already outside the door. She 
stood up, wavering, as if she were unsure whether or not to go after him. Her fingers 
kneaded at the red material she was holding. "Bob!" she called again, more urgently, 
and she turned to drop the kimono on Elena's bed before following him. 

But as she turned she gasped, a hand flying to her mouth. Her whole body 
stiffened. Her eyes stared into Elena's through the silvery pane of glass. For a long 
moment, they stared at each other that way, neither moving. Then Aunt Judith's hand 
came away from her mouth, and she began to shriek. 


Four 

Something yanked Elena out of the tree and, yowling a protest, she fell and landed 
on her feet like a cat. Her knees hit the ground a second later and got bruised. 

She reared back, fingers hooked into claws to attack whoever had done it. Damon 
slapped her hand away. 

"Why did you grab me?" she demanded. 

"Why didn't you stay where I put you?" he snapped. 

They glared at each other, equally furious. Then Elena was distracted. The 
shrieking was still going on upstairs, augmented now by rattling and banging at the 
window. Damon nudged her against the house, where they couldn't be seen from 
above. 

"Let's get away from this noise," he said fastidiously, looking up. Without waiting 
for a response, he caught her arm. Elena resisted. 

"I have to go in there!" 

"You can't." He gave her a wolfish smile. "I mean that literally. You can't go in 
that house. You haven't been invited." 

Momentarily nonplussed, Elena let him tow her a few steps. Then she dug her 
heels in again. 

"But I need my diary!" 

Page 21 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
"What?" 
"It's in the closet, under the floorboards. And I need it. I can't go to sleep without 


my diary." Elena didn't know why she was making such a fuss, but it seemed 
important. 
Damon looked exasperated; then, his face cleared. "Here," he said calmly, eyes 

glinting. He withdrew something from his jacket. "Take it." 
Elena eyed his offering doubtfully. 
"It's your diary, isn't it?" 
"Yes, but it's my old one. I want my new one." 
"This one will have to do, because this one is all you're getting. Come on before 


they wake up the whole neighborhood." His voice had turned cold and commanding 


again. 
Elena considered the book he held. It was small, with a blue velvet cover and a 
brass lock. Not the newest edition perhaps, but it was familiar to her. She decided it 
was acceptable. 


She let Damon lead her out into the night. 
She didn't ask where they were going. She didn't much care. But she recognized 
. 


the house on Magnolia Avenue; it was where Alaric Saltzman was staying. 
the house on Magnolia Avenue; it was where Alaric Saltzman was staying. 
Elena licked her lips. 
"No," Damon said shortly. "This one's not for biting. There's something fishy 


about him, but you should be safe enough in the house. I've slept here before. Up 
here." He led her up a flight of stairs to an attic with one small window. It was 
crowded with stored objects: sleds, skis, a hammock. At the far end, an old mattress 
lay on the floor. 

"He won't even know you're here in the morning. Lie down." Elena obeyed, 
assuming a position that seemed natural to her. She lay on her back, hands folded 
over the diary that she held to her breast. 

Damon dropped a piece of oilcloth over her, covering her bare feet. 
"Go to sleep, Elena," he said. 
He bent over her, and for a moment she thought he was going to... do something. 


Her thoughts were too muddled. But his night black eyes filled her vision. Then he 


Page 22 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
pulled back, and she could breathe again. The gloom of the attic settled in on her. 
Her eyes drifted shut and she slept. 


She woke slowly, assembling information about where she was, piece by piece. 
Somebody's attic from the looks of it. What was she doing here? 


Rats or mice were scuffling somewhere among the piles of oilcloth-draped 
objects, but the sound didn't bother her. The faintest trace of pale light showed 
around the edges of the shuttered window. Elena pushed her makeshift blanket off 
and got up to investigate. 


It was definitely someone's attic, and not that of anyone she knew. She felt as if 
she had been sick for a long time and had just woken up from her illness. What day 
is it? she wondered. 


She could hear voices below her. Downstairs. Something told her to be careful 
and quiet. She felt afraid of making any kind of disturbance. She eased the attic door 
open without a sound and cautiously descended to the landing. Looking down, she 
could see a living room. She recognized it; she'd sat on that ottoman when Alaric 
Saltzman had given a party. She was in the Ramsey house. 


And Alaric Saltzman was down there; she could see the top of his sandy head. 
His voice puzzled her. After a moment she realized it was because he didn't sound 
fatuous or inane or any of the ways Alaric usually sounded in class. He wasn't 
spouting psycho-babble, either. He was speaking coolly and decisively to two other 
men. 


"She might be anywhere, even right under our noses. More likely outside town, 


. 
though. Maybe in the woods." 


though. Maybe in the woods." 


"Remember, the first two victims were found near the woods," said the other 
man. Is that Dr. Feinberg? Elena thought. What's he doing here? What am I doing 
here? 


"No, it's more than that," Alaric was saying. The other men were listening to him 
with respect, even with deference. "The woods are tied up in this. They may have a 
hiding place out there, a lair where they can go to earth if they're discovered. If there 
is one, I'll find it." 


"Are you sure?" said Dr. Feinberg. 


"I'm sure," Alaric said briefly. 


"And that's where you think Elena is," said the principal. "But will she stay there? 
Or will she come back into town?" 


"I don't know." Alaric paced a few steps and picked up a book from the coffee 


Page 23 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
table, running his thumbs over it absently. "One way to find out is to watch her 
friends. Bonnie McCullough and that dark-haired girl, Meredith. Chances are they'll 
be the first ones to see her. That's how it usually happens." 

"And once we do track her down?" Dr. Feinberg asked. 

"Leave that to me," Alaric said quietly and grimly. He shut the book and dropped 
it on the coffee table with a disturbingly conclusive sound. 

The principal glanced at his watch. "I'd better get moving; the service starts at ten 
o'clock. I presume you'll both be there?" He paused on his way to the door and 
looked back, his manner irresolute. "Alaric, I hope you can take care of this. When I 
called you in, things hadn't gone this far. Now I'm beginning to wonder-" 

"I can take care of it, Brian. I told you; leave it to me. Would you rather have 
Robert E. Lee in all the papers, not just as the scene of a tragedy but also as 'The 
Haunted High School of Boone County'? A gathering place for ghouls? The school 
where the undead walk? Is that the kind of publicity you want?" 

Mr. Newcastle hesitated, chewing his lip, then nodded, still looking unhappy. "All 
right, Alaric. But make it quick and clean. I'll see you at the church." He left and Dr. 
Fein-berg followed him. 

Alaric stood there for some time, apparently staring into space. At last he nodded 
once and went out the front door himself. 

Elena slowly trailed back up the stairs. 

Now what had all that been about? She felt confused, as if she were floating loose 
in time and space. She needed to know what day it was, why she was here, and why 
she felt so frightened. Why she felt so intensely that no one must see her or hear her 
or notice her at all. 


Looking around the attic, she saw nothing that would give her any help. Where 
she had been lying there were only the mattress and the oilcloth-and a little blue 
book.

When she finished, she was weak with fear and horror. Bright spots danced and 
shimmered before her eyes. There was so much pain in these pages. So many 
schemes, so many secrets, so much need. It was the story of a girl who'd felt lost in 
her own hometown, in her own family. Who'd been looking for... something, 
something she could never quite reach. But that wasn't what caused this throbbing 
panic in her chest that drained all the energy from her body. That wasn't why she felt 
as if she were falling even when she sat as still as she could get. What caused the 
panic was that she remembered. 

Page 24 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
She remembered everything now. 


The bridge, the rushing water. The terror as the air left her lungs and there was 
nothing but liquid to breathe. The way it had hurt. And the final instant when it had 
stopped hurting, when everything had stopped. When everything... stopped. 


Oh, Stefan, I was so frightened, she thought. And the same fear was inside her 
now. In the woods, how could she have behaved like that to Stefan? How could she 
have forgotten him, everything he meant to her? What had made her act that way? 


But she knew. At the center of her consciousness, she knew. Nobody got up and 
walked away from a drowning like that. Nobody got up and walked away alive. 


Slowly, she rose and went to look at the shuttered window. The darkened pane of 
glass acted as a mirror, throwing her reflection back at her. 


It was not the reflection she'd seen in her dream, where she had run down a hall of 
mirrors that seemed to have a life of their own. There was nothing sly or cruel about 
this face. Just the same, it was subtly different from what she was used to seeing. 
There was a pale glow to her skin and a telling hollowness about the eyes. Elena 
touched fingertips to her neck, on either side. This was where Stefan and Damon 
had each taken her blood. Had it really been enough times, and had she really taken 
enough of theirs in return? 


It must have been. And now, for the rest of her life, for the rest of her existence, 
she would have to feed as Stefan did. She would have to... 


She sank to her knees, pressing her forehead against the bare wood of a wall. I 
can't, she thought. Oh, please, I can't; I can't. 


She had never been very religious. But from that deep place inside, her terror was 
welling up, and every particle of her being joined in the cry for aid. Oh, please, she 
thought. Oh, please, please, help me. She didn't ask for anything specific; she 


. 
couldn't gather her thoughts that far. Only: Oh, please help me, oh please, please. 


couldn't gather her thoughts that far. Only: Oh, please help me, oh please, please. 


Her face was still pale but eerily beautiful, like fine porcelain lit from within. Her 
eyes were still smudged with shadows. But there was a resolve in them. 


She had to find Stefan. If there was any help for her, he would know of it. And if 
there wasn't... well, she needed him all the more. There was nowhere else she 
wanted to be except with him. 


She shut the door of the attic carefully behind her as she went out. Alaric 
Saltzman mustn't discover her hiding place. On the wall, she saw a calendar with the 
days up to December 4 crossed off. Four days since last Saturday night. She'd slept 
for four days. 


Page 25 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
When she reached the front door, she cringed from the daylight outside. It hurt. 
Even though the sky was so overcast that rain or snow looked imminent, it hurt her 
eyes. She had to force herself to leave the safety of the house, and then she felt a 
gnawing paranoia about being out in the open. She slunk along beside fences, 
staying close to trees, ready to melt into the shadows. She felt like a shadow herself 
-or a ghost, in Honoria Fell's long white gown. She would frighten the wits out of 
anyone who saw her. 

But all her circumspection seemed to be wasted. There was no one on the streets 
to see her; the town might have been abandoned. She went by seemingly deserted 
houses, forsaken yards, closed stores. Presently she saw parked cars lining the 
street, but they were empty, too. 

And then she saw a shape against the sky that stopped her in her tracks. A 
steeple, white against the thick dark clouds. Elena's legs trembled as she made 
herself creep closer to the building. She'd known this church all her life; she'd seen 
the cross inscribed on that wall a thousand times. But now she edged toward it as if 
it were a caged animal that might break loose and bite her. She pressed one hand to 
the stone wall and slid it nearer and nearer to the carved symbol. 

When her outspread fingers touched the arm of the cross, her eyes filled and her 
throat ached. She let her hand glide along it until it gently covered the engraving. 
Then she leaned against the wall and let the tears come. 

I'm not evil, she thought. I did things I shouldn't have. I thought about myself too 
much; I never thanked Matt and Bonnie and Meredith for all they did for me. I 
should have played more with Margaret and been nicer to Aunt Judith. But I'm not 
evil. I'm not damned. 

When she could see again, she looked up at the building. Mr. Newcastle had said 
something about the church. Was it this one he meant? 

She avoided the front of the church and the main doorway. There was a side door 
that led to the choir loft, and she slipped up the stairs noiselessly and looked down 
from the gallery. 

She saw at once why the streets had been so empty. It seemed as if everyone in 


Fell's Church was here, every seat in every pew filled, and the back of the church 
packed solid with people standing. Staring at the front rows, Elena realized that she 
recognized every face; they were members of the senior class, and neighbors, and 
friends of Aunt Judith. Aunt Judith was there, too, wearing the black dress she'd 
worn to Elena's parents' funeral. 

Fell's Church was here, every seat in every pew filled, and the back of the church

worn to Elena's parents' funeral.

L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
"... share our remembrances of this very special girl," he said, and he moved 
aside. 


Elena watched what happened after with the unearthly feeling that she had a loge 
seat at a play. She was not at all involved in the events down there on stage; she was 
only a spectator, but it was her life she was watching. 


Mr. Carson, Sue Carson's father, came up and talked about her. The Carsons had 
known her since she was born, and he talked about the days she and Sue had played 
in their front yard in the summer. He talked about the beautiful and accomplished 
young lady she had become. He got a frog in his throat and had to stop and take off 
his glasses. 


Sue Carson went up. She and Elena hadn't been close friends since elementary 
school, but they'd remained on good terms. Sue had been one of the few girls who'd 
stayed on Elena's side after Stefan had come under suspicion for Mr. Tanner's 
murder. But now Sue was crying as if she'd lost a sister. 


"A lot of people weren't nice to Elena after Halloween," she said, wiping her eyes 
and going on. "And I know that hurt her. But Elena was strong. She never changed 
just to conform to what other people thought she should be. And I respected her for 
that, so much..." Sue's voice wobbled. "When I was up for Homecoming Queen, I 
wanted to be chosen, but I knew I wouldn't be and that was all right. Because if 
Robert E. Lee ever had a queen, it was Elena. And I think she always will be now, 
because that's how we'll all remember her. And I think that for years to come the 
girls who will go to our school might remember her and think about how she stuck 
by what she thought was right..." This time Sue couldn't steady her voice and the 
reverend helped her back to her seat. 


The girls in the senior class, even the ones that had been nastiest and most 
spiteful, were crying and holding hands. Girls Elena knew for a fact hated her were 
sniffling. Suddenly she was everybody's best friend. 


There were boys crying, too. Shocked, Elena huddled closer to the railing. She 
couldn't stop watching, even though it was the most horrible thing she had ever seen. 


Frances Decatur got up, her plain face plainer than ever with grief. "She went out 
of her way to be nice to me," she said huskily. "She let me eat lunch with her." 
Rubbish, Elena thought. I only spoke to you in the first place because you were 
useful in finding out information about Stefan. But it was the same with each person 
who went up to the pulpit; no one could find enough words to praise Elena. 


. 
"I always admired her..." 


"I always admired her..." 


"One of my favorite students..." 


When Meredith rose, Elena's whole body stiffened. She didn't know if she could 
deal with this. But the dark-haired girl was one of the few people in the church who 


Page 27 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
wasn't crying, although her face had a grave, sad look that reminded Elena of 
Honoria Fell as she looked on her tomb. 

"When I think about Elena, I think about the good times we had together," she 
said, speaking quietly and with her customary self-control. "Elena always had ideas, 
and she could make the most boring work into fun. I never told her that, and now I 
wish I had. I wish that I could talk to her one more time, just so she would know. 
And if Elena could hear me now"-Meredith looked around the church and drew a 
long breath, apparently to calm herself-"if she could hear me now, I would tell her 
how much those good times meant to me, and how much I wish that we could still 
have them. Like the Thursday nights we used to sit together in her room, practicing 
for the debate team. I wish we could do that just once more like we used to." 
Meredith took another long breath and shook her head. "But I know we can't, and 
that hurts." 

What are you talking about? Elena thought, her misery interrupted by 
bewilderment. We used to practice for the debate team on Wednesday nights, not 
Thursdays. And it wasn't in my bedroom; it was in yours. And it was no fun at all; in 
fact, we ended up quitting because we both hated it... 

Suddenly, watching Meredith's carefully composed face, so calm on the outside 
to conceal the tension within, Elena felt her heart begin to pound. 

Meredith was sending a message, a message only Elena could be expected to 
understand. Which meant that Meredith expected Elena to be able to hear it. 

Meredith knew. 

Had Stefan told her? Elena scanned the rows of mourners below, realizing for the 
first time that Stefan wasn't among them. Neither was Matt. No, it didn't seem likely 
that Stefan would have told Meredith, or that Meredith would choose this way of 
getting a message to her if he had. Then Elena remembered the way Meredith had 
looked at her the night they had rescued Stefan from the well, when Elena had asked 
to be left alone with Stefan. 

She remembered those keen dark eyes studying her face more than once in the 
last months, and the way Meredith had seemed to grow quieter and more thoughtful 
each time Elena came up with some odd request. 

Meredith had guessed then. Elena wondered just how much of the truth she'd put 
together. 

Bonnie was coming up now, crying in earnest. That was surprising; if Meredith 
knew, why hadn't she told Bonnie? But maybe Meredith had only a suspicion, 
something she didn't want to share with Bonnie in case it turned out to be a false 


hope. 

hope. 

Page 28 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
"Thank you," Bonnie said, wiping her streaming eyes. She tilted her head back to 
look at the ceiling, either to regain her poise or to get inspiration. As she did, Elena 
saw something that no one else could see: she saw Bonnie's face drain of color and 
of expression, not like somebody about to faint, but in a way that was all too 
familiar. 


A chill crawled up Elena's backbone. Not here. Oh, God, of all times and places, 
not here. 


But it was already happening. Bonnie's chin had lowered; she was looking at the 
congregation again. Except that this time she didn't seem to see them at all, and the 
voice that came from Bonnie's throat was not Bonnie's voice. 


"No one is what they appear. Remember that. No one is what they appear." Then 
she just stood there, unmoving, staring straight ahead with blank eyes. 


People began to shuffle and look at one another. There was a murmur of worry. 


"Remember that-remember-no one is what they seem..." Bonnie swayed 
suddenly, and Reverend Bethea ran to her while another man hastened up from the 
other side. The second man had a bald head that was now shining with sweat-Mr. 
Newcastle, Elena realized. And there at the back of the church, striding up the nave, 
was Alaric Saltzman. He reached Bonnie just as she fainted, and Elena heard a step 
behind her on the stair.

Five 


Dr. Feinberg, Elena thought wildly, trying to twist around to look and 
simultaneously press herself into the shadows. But it wasn't the small, hawk-nosed 
visage of the doctor that met her eyes. It was a face with features as fine as those on 
a Roman coin or medallion, and haunted green eyes. Time caught for a moment, and 
then Elena was in his arms. 


"Oh, Stefan. Stefan..." 


She felt his body go still with shock. He was holding her mechanically, lightly, as 
if she were a stranger who'd mistaken him for someone else. 


"Stefan," she said desperately, burrowing her face into his shoulder, trying to get 
some response. She couldn't bear it if he rejected her; if he hated her now she would 
die... 


With a moan, she tried to get even closer to him, wanting to merge with him 
completely, to disappear inside him. Oh, please, she thought, oh, please, oh, please 
... 


"Elena. Elena, it's all right; I've got you." He went on talking to her, repeating silly 
nonsense meant to soothe, stroking her hair. And she could feel the change as his 
arms tightened around her. He knew who he was holding now. For the first time 


Page 29 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
since she'd awakened that day, she felt safe. Still, it was a long while before she 
could relax her grip on him even slightly. She wasn't crying; she was gasping in 
panic. 

At last she felt the world start to settle into place around her. She didn't let go, 
though, not yet. She simply stood for endless minutes with her head on his shoulder, 
drinking in the comfort and security of his nearness. 

Then she raised her head to look into his eyes. 
When she'd thought of Stefan earlier that day, she'd thought of how he might help 
her. She'd meant to ask him, to beg him, to save her from this nightmare, to make 


her the way she had been before. But now, as she looked at him, she felt a strange 
despairing resignation flow through her. 
"There's nothing to be done about it, is there?" she said very softly. 
He didn't pretend to misunderstand. "No," he said, equally soft. 
Elena felt as if she had taken some final step over an invisible line and that there 


was no returning. When she could speak again, she said, "I'm sorry for the way I 
acted toward you in the woods. I don't know why I did those things. I remember 
doing them, but I can't remember why." 

"You're sorry?" His voice shook. "Elena, after all I've done to you, all that's 
happened to you because of me..." He couldn't finish, and they clung to each other. 

"Very touching," said a voice from the stairway. "Do you want me to imitate a 

violin?" 

violin?" 
"How did you get here?" said Stefan. 
"The same way you did, I presume. Attracted by the blazing beacon of the fair 


Elena's distress." Damon was really angry; Elena could tell. Not just annoyed or 


discommoded but in a white heat of rage and hostility. 
But he'd been decent to her when she'd been confused and irrational. He'd taken 
her to shelter; he'd kept her safe. And he hadn't kissed her while she'd been in that 
horrifyingly vulnerable state. He'd been... kind to her. 


"Incidentally, there's something going on down there," Damon said. 
"I know; it's Bonnie again," said Elena, releasing Stefan and moving back. 
"That's not what I meant. This is outside." 
Startled, Elena followed him down to the first bend in the stairs, where there was a 


Page 30 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
window overlooking the parking lot. She felt Stefan behind her as she looked down 
at the scene below. 


A crowd of people had come out of the church, but they were standing in a solid 
phalanx at the edge of the lot, not going any farther. Opposite them, in the parking 
lot itself, was an equally large assembly of dogs. 


It looked like two armies facing each other. What was eerie, though, was that both 
groups were absolutely motionless. The people seemed to be paralyzed by 
uneasiness, and the dogs seemed to be waiting for something. 


Elena saw the dogs first as different breeds. There were small dogs like 
sharp-faced corgis and brown-and-black silky terriers and a Lhasa apso with long 
golden hair. There were medium-sized dogs like springer spaniels and Airedales and 
one beautiful snow white Samoyed. And there were the big dogs: a barrel-chested 
rottweiler with a cropped tail, a panting gray wolfhound, and a giant schnauzer, pure 
black. Then Elena began to recognize individuals. 


"That's Mr. Grunbaum's boxer and the Sullivans' German shepherd. But what's 
going on with them?" 


The people, originally uneasy, now looked frightened. They stood shoulder to 
shoulder, no one wanting to break out of the front line and move any closer to the 
animals. 


And yet the dogs weren't doing anything, just sitting or standing, some with their 
tongues lolling gently out. Strange, though, how still they were, Elena thought. Every 
tiny motion, such as the slightest twitch of tail or ears, seemed vastly exaggerated. 
And there were no wagging tails, no signs of friendliness. Just... waiting. 


Robert was toward the back of the crowd. Elena was surprised at seeing him, but 
for a moment she couldn't think of why. Then she realized it was because he hadn't 
been in the church. As she watched, he drew farther apart from the group,

disappearing under the overhang below Elena. 


Someone had moved out of the front line at last. It was Douglas Carson, Elena 
realized, Sue Carson's married older brother. He'd stepped into the no-man's-land 
between the dogs and the people, one hand slightly extended. 


A springer spaniel with long ears like brown satin turned her head. Her white 
stump of a tail quivered slightly, questioningly, and her brown-and-white muzzle 
lifted. But she didn't come to the young man. 


Doug Carson took another step. "Chelsea... good girl. Come here, Chelsea. 
Come!" He snapped his fingers. 


"What do you sense from those dogs down there?" Damon murmured. 


Page 31 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
Stefan shook his head without looking away from the window. "Nothing," he said 
shortly. 


"Neither do I." Damon's eyes were narrowed, his head tilted back appraisingly, 
but his slightly bared teeth reminded Elena of the wolfhound. "But we should be able 
to, you know. They ought to have some emotions we can pick up on. Instead, every 
time I try to probe them it's like running into a blank white wall." 


Elena wished she knew what they were talking about. "What do you mean 'probe 
them'?" she said. "They're animals." 


"Appearances can be deceiving," Damon said ironically, and Elena thought about 
the rainbow lights in the feathers of the crow that had followed her since the first day 
of school. If she looked closely, she could see those same rainbow lights in 
Damon's silky hair. "But animals have emotions, in any case. If your Powers are 
strong enough, you can examine their minds." 


And my Powers aren't, thought Elena. She was startled by the twinge of envy that 
went through her. Just a few minutes ago she'd been clinging to Stefan, frantic to get 
rid of any Powers she had, to change herself back. And now, she wished she were 
stronger. Damon always had an odd effect on her. 


"I may not be able to probe Chelsea, but I don't think Doug should go any 
closer," she said aloud. 


Stefan had been staring fixedly out the window, his eyebrows drawn together. 
Now he nodded fractionally, but with a sudden sense of urgency. "I don't either," he 
said. 


"C'mon, Chelsea, be a good girl. Come here." Doug Carson had almost reached 
the first row of dogs. All eyes, human and canine, were fixed on him, and even such 
tiny movements as twitches had stopped. If Elena hadn't seen the sides of one or 
two dogs hollow and fill with their breathing, she might have thought the whole 
group was some giant museum display. 


Doug had come to a halt. Chelsea was watching him from behind the corgi and 
the Samoyed. Doug clucked his tongue. He stretched out his hand, hesitated, and

then stretched it out farther. 


"Yes." She could see his gaze unfocus with concentration; then, he shook his 
head, exhaling like a person who's tried to lift some-thing too heavy. "It's no good; 
I'm burnt out. I can't do it from here." 


Below, Chelsea's lips skinned back from her teeth. The red-gold Airedale rose to 
her feet in one beautifully smooth movement, as if pulled by strings. The 
hindquarters of the rottweiler bunched. 


Page 32 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
And then they sprang. Elena couldn't see which of the dogs was the first; they 
seemed to move together like a great wave. Half a dozen hit Doug Carson with 
enough force to knock him backward, and he disappeared under their massed 
bodies. 


The air was full of hellish noise, from a metallic baying that set the church rafters 
ringing and gave Elena an instant headache, to a deep-throated continuous growl that 
she felt rather than heard. Dogs were tearing at clothing, snarling, lunging, while the 
crowd scattered and screamed. 


Elena caught sight of Alaric Saltzman at the edge of the parking lot, the only one 
who wasn't running. He was standing stiffly, and she thought she could see his lips 
moving, and his hands. 


Everywhere else was pandemonium. Someone had gotten a hose and was turning 
it into the thick of the pack, but it was having no effect. The dogs seemed to have 
gone mad. When Chelsea raised her brown-and-white muzzle from her master's 
body, it was tinged with red. 


Elena's heart was pounding so that she could barely breathe. "They need help!" 
she said, just as Stefan broke away from the window and went down the stairs, 
taking them two and three at a time. Elena was halfway down the stairs herself when 
she realized two things: Damon wasn't following her, and she couldn't let herself be 
seen. 


She couldn't. The hysteria it would cause, the questions, the fear and hatred once 
the questions were answered. Something that ran deeper than compassion or 
sympathy or the need to help wrenched her back, flattening her against the wall. 


In the dim, cool interior of the church, she glimpsed a boiling pocket of activity. 
People were dashing back and forth, shouting. Dr. Feinberg, Mr. McCullough, 
Reverend Bethea. The still point of the circle was Bonnie lying on a pew with 
Meredith and Aunt Judith and Mrs. McCullough bent over her. "Something evil," she 
was moaning, and then Aunt Judith's head came up, turning in Elena's direction. 


Elena scuttled up the stairs as quickly as she could, praying Aunt Judith hadn't 
seen her. Damon was at the window. 


"I can't go down there. They think I'm dead!" 


. 
"Oh, you've remembered that. Good for you." 


"Oh, you've remembered that. Good for you." 


"He'll think you're an interesting specimen, all right." 


"Then I can't go. But you can. Why don't you do something?" 


Damon continued to look out the window, eyebrows hiking up. "Why?" 


Page 33 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
"Why?" Elena's alarm and overexcitement reached flash point and she almost 
slapped him. "Because they need help! Because you can help. Don't you care about 
anything besides yourself?" 

Damon was wearing his most impenetrable mask, the expression of polite inquiry 
he'd worn when he invited himself to her house for dinner. But she knew that beneath 
it he was angry, angry at finding her and Stefan together. He was baiting her on 
purpose and with savage enjoyment. 

And she couldn't help her reaction, her frustrated, impotent rage. She started for 
him, and he caught her wrists and held her off, his eyes boring into hers. She was 
startled to hear the sound that came from her lips then; it was a hiss that sounded 
more feline than human. She realized her fingers were hooked into claws. 

What am I doing? Attacking him because he won't defend people against the dogs 
that are attacking them? What kind of sense does that make? Breathing hard, she 
relaxed her hands and wet her lips. She stepped back and he let her. 

There was a long moment while they stared at each other. 

"I'm going down," Elena said quietly and turned. 

"No." 

"They need help." 

"All right, then, damn you." She'd never heard Damon's voice so low, or so 
furious. "I'll-" he broke off and Elena, turning back quickly, saw him slam a fist 
into the window-sill, rattling the glass. But his attention was outside and his voice 
perfectly composed again when he said dryly, "Help has arrived." 

It was the fire department. Their hoses were much more powerful than the garden 
hose, and the jet streams of water drove the lunging dogs off with sheer force. Elena 
saw a sheriff with a gun and bit the inside of her cheek as he aimed and sighted. 
There was a crack, and the giant schnauzer went down. The sheriff aimed again. 

It ended quickly after that. Several dogs were already running from the barrage of 
water, and with the second crack of the pistol more broke from the pack and headed 
for the edges of the parking lot. It was as if the purpose that had driven them had 
released them all at once. Elena felt a rush of relief as she saw Stefan standing 
unharmed in the middle of the rout, shoving a dazed-looking golden retriever away 
from Doug Carson's form. Chelsea took a skulking step toward her master and 
looked into his face, head and tail drooping. 


"It's all over," Damon said. He sounded only mildly interested, but Elena glanced 
at him sharply. All right then, damn you, I'll what? she thought. What had he been 
about to say? He wasn't in any mood to tell her, but she was in a mood to push. 

"It's all over," Damon said. He sounded only mildly interested, but Elena glanced 

Page 34 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
at him sharply. All right then, damn you, I'll what? she thought. What had he been 
about to say? He wasn't in any mood to tell her, but she was in a mood to push. 

He stiffened, then turned. "Well?" 

For a second they stood looking at each other, and then there was a step on the 
stair. Stefan had returned. 

"Stefan... you're hurt," she said, blinking, suddenly disoriented. 

"I'm all right." He wiped blood off his cheek with a tattered sleeve. 

"What about Doug?" Elena asked, swallowing. 

"I don't know. He is hurt. A lot of people are. That was the strangest thing I've 
ever seen." 

Elena moved away from Damon, up the stairs into the choir loft. She felt that she 
had to think, but her head was pounding. The strangest thing Stefan had ever seen... 
that was saying a lot. Something strange in Fell's Church. 

She reached the wall behind the last row of seats and put a hand against it, sliding 
down to sit on the floor. Things seemed at once confused and frighteningly clear. 
Something strange in Fell's Church. The day of the founders' celebration she would 
have sworn she didn't care anything about Fell's Church or the people in it. But now 
she knew differently. Looking down on the memorial service, she had begun to think 
perhaps she did care. 

And then, when the dogs had attacked outside, she'd known it. She felt somehow 
responsible for the town, in a way she had never felt before. 

Her earlier sense of desolation and loneliness had been pushed aside for the 
moment. There was something more important than her own problems now. And 
she clung to that something, because the truth was that she really couldn't deal with 
her own situation, no, she really, really couldn't... 

She heard the gasping half sob she gave then and looked up to see both Stefan 
and Damon in the choir loft, looking at her. She shook her head slightly, putting a 
hand to it, feeling as if she were coming out of a dream. 

"Elena... ?" 

It was Stefan who spoke, but Elena addressed herself to the other one. 

"Damon," she said shakily, "if I ask you something, will you tell me the truth? I 
know you didn't chase me off Wickery Bridge. I could feel whatever it was, and it 
was different. But I want to ask you this: was it you who dumped Stefan in the old 
Francher well a month ago?" 

"In a well?" Damon leaned back against the opposite wall, arms crossed over his 
chest. He looked politely incredulous. 

Page 35 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
"On Halloween night, the night Mr. Tanner was killed. After you showed yourself 


for the first time to Stefan in the woods. He told me he left you in the clearing and 
started to walk to his car but that someone attacked him before he reached it. When 
he woke up, he was trapped in the well, and he would have died there if Bonnie 
hadn't led us to him. I always assumed you were the one who attacked him. He 
always assumed you were the one. But were you?"

hadn't led us to him. I always assumed you were the one who attacked him. He 
always assumed you were the one. But were you?" 

"As a matter of fact, no," he said. 

Elena let out her breath. 

"You can't believe that!" Stefan exploded. "You can't believe anything he says." 

"Why should I lie?" Damon returned, clearly enjoying Stefan's loss of control. "I 
admit freely to killing Tanner. I drank his blood until he shriveled like a prune. And I 
wouldn't mind doing the same thing to you, brother. But a well? It's hardly my 
style." 

"I believe you," Elena said. Her mind was rushing ahead. She turned to Stefan. 
"Don't you feel it? There's something else here in Fell's Church, something that may 
not even be human-may never have been human, I mean. Something that chased 
me, forced my car off the bridge. Something that made those dogs attack people. 
Some terrible force that's here, something evil..." Her voice trailed off, and she 
looked over toward the interior of the church where she had seen Bonnie lying. 
"Something evil..." she repeated softly. A cold wind seemed to blow inside her, and 
she huddled into herself, feeling vulnerable and alone. 

"If you're looking for evil," Stefan said harshly, "you don't have to look far." 

"Don't be any more stupid than you can help," said Damon. "I told you four days 
ago that someone else had killed Elena. And I said that I was going to find that 
someone and deal with him. And I am." He uncrossed his arms and straightened up. 
"You two can continue that private conversation you were having when I 
interrupted." 

"Damon, wait." Elena hadn't been able to help the shudder that tore through her 
when he said killed. I can't have been killed; I'm still here, she thought wildly, feeling 
panic swell up in her again. But now she pushed the panic aside to speak to Damon. 

"Whatever this thing is, it's strong," she said. "I felt it when it was after me, and it 
seemed to fill the whole sky. I don't think any of us would stand a chance against it 
alone." 

Page 36 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
"So?" 


"So..." Elena hadn't had time to gather her thoughts this far. She was running 
purely on instinct, on intuition. And intuition told her not to let Damon go. "So... I 
think we three ought to stick together. I think we have a much better chance of 
finding it and dealing with it together than separately. And maybe we can stop it

before it hurts or-or kills-anyone else." 


before it hurts or-or kills-anyone else." 


Elena stared at him. Of course it wasn't her choice, if he meant romantically. She 
was wearing the ring Stefan had given her; she and Stefan belonged together. 


But then she remembered something else, just a flash: looking up at Damon's face 
in the woods and feeling such-such excitement, such affinity with him. As if he 
understood the flame that burned inside her as nobody else ever could. As if 
together they could do anything they liked, conquer the world or destroy it; as if they 
were better than anyone else who had ever lived. 


I was out of my mind, irrational, she told herself, but that little flash of memory 
wouldn't go away. 


And then she remembered something else: how Damon had acted later that night, 
how he'd kept her safe, even been gentle with her. 


Stefan was looking at her, and his expression had changed from belligerence to 
bitter anger and fear. Part of her wanted to reassure him completely, to throw her 
arms around him and tell him that she was his and always would be and that nothing 
else mattered. Not the town, not Damon, not anything. 


But she wasn't doing it. Because another part of her was saying that the town did 
matter. And because still another part was just terribly, terribly confused. So 
confused... 


She felt a trembling begin deep inside her, and then she found she couldn't make it 
stop. Emotional overload, she thought, and put her head in her hands.

"She's already made her choice. You saw it yourself when you 'interrupted' us. 
You've already chosen, haven't you, Elena?" Stefan said it not smugly, or as a 
demand, but with a kind of desperate bravado. 


"I..." Elena looked up. "Stefan, I love you. But don't you understand, if I have a 
choice right now I have to choose for all of us to stay together. Just for now. Do 
you understand?" Seeing only stoniness in Stefan's face, she turned to Damon. "Do 


Page 37 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
you?" 

"I think so." He gave her a secret, possessive smile. "I told Stefan from the 
beginning that he was selfish not to share you. Brothers should share things, you 
know." 

"That's not what I meant." 

"Isn't it?" Damon smiled again. 

"No," Stefan said. "I don't understand, and I don't see how you can ask me to 
work with him. He's evil, Elena. He kills for pleasure; he has no conscience at all. He 
doesn't care about Fell's Church; he said that himself. He's a monster-" 

"Right now he's being more cooperative than you are," Elena said. She reached 
for Stefan's hand, searching for some way to get through to him. "Stefan, I need 
you. And we both need him. Can't you try to accept that?" When he didn't answer 
she added, "Stefan, do you really want to be mortal enemies with your brother 
forever?" 

"Do you really think he wants anything else?" 

Elena stared down at their joined hands, looking at the planes and curves and 
shadows. She didn't answer for a minute, and when she did it was very quietly. 

"He stopped me from killing you," she said. 

She felt the flare of Stefan's defensive anger, then felt it slowly fade. Something 
like defeat crept through him, and he bowed his head. 

"That's true," he said. "And, anyway, who am I to call him evil? What's he done 
that I haven't done myself?" 

We need to talk, Elena thought, hating this self-hatred of his. But this wasn't the 
time or place. 

"Then you do agree?" she said hesitantly. "Stefan, tell me what you're thinking." 

"Right now I'm thinking that you always get your way. Because you always do, 
don't you, Elena?" 

Elena looked into his eyes, noticing how the pupils were dilated, so that only a 
ring of green iris showed around the edge. There was no longer anger there, but the 
tiredness and the bitterness remained. 


But I'm not just doing it for myself, she thought, thrusting out of her mind the 
sudden surge of self-doubt. I'll prove that to you, Stefan; you'll see. For once I'm 
not doing something for my own convenience. 

But I'm not just doing it for myself, she thought, thrusting out of her mind the 

Page 38

sudden surge of self-doubt. I'll prove that to you, Stefan; you'll see. For once I'm 
not doing something for my own convenience. 

"Yes. I... agree." 

"And I agree," said Damon, extending his own hand with exaggerated courtesy. 
He captured Elena's before she could say anything. "In fact, we all seem to be in a 
frenzy of pure agreement." 

Don't, Elena thought, but at that moment, standing in the cool twilight of the choir 
loft, she felt that it was true, that they were all three connected, and in accord, and 
strong. 

Then Stefan pulled his hand away. In the silence that followed, Elena could hear 
the sounds outside and in the church below. There was still crying and the 
occasional shout, but the overall urgency was gone. Looking out the window, she 
saw people picking their way across the wet parking lot between the little groups that 
huddled over wounded victims. Dr. Feinberg was moving from island to island, 
apparently dispensing medical advice. The victims looked like survivors of a 
hurricane or earthquake. 

"No one is what they seem," Elena said. 

"What?" 

"That's what Bonnie said during the memorial service. She had another one of her 
fits. I think it might be important." She tried to put her thoughts in order. "I think 
there are people in town that we ought to look out for. Like Alaric Saltzman." She 
told them, briefly, what she had overheard earlier that day in Alaric's house. "He's 
not what he seems, but I don't know exactly what he is. I think we should watch him. 
And since I obviously can't appear in public, you two are going to have to do it. But 
you can't let him suspect you know-" Elena broke off as Damon held up a hand 
swiftly. 

Down at the base of the stairs, a voice was calling. "Stefan? Are you up there?" 
And then, to someone else, "I thought I saw him go up here." 

It sounded like Mr. Carson. "Go," Elena hissed almost inaudibly to Stefan, "You 
have to be as normal as possible so you can stay here in Fell's Church. I'll be all 
right." 

"But where will you go?" 

"To Meredith's. I'll explain later. Go on." 

Stefan hesitated, and then started down the stairs, calling, "I'm coming." Then he 
pulled back. "I'm not leaving you with him," he said flatly. 

Elena threw her hands up in exasperation. "Then both of you go. You just agreed 
to work together; are you going to go back on your word now?" she added to 
Damon, who was looking unyielding himself. 

Page 39 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
. 
He gave another of his little shrugs. "All right. Just one thing-are you hungry?" 


He gave another of his little shrugs. "All right. Just one thing-are you hungry?" 


"That's good. But later on, you will be. Remember that." He crowded Stefan 
down the stairs, earning himself a searing look. But Elena heard Stefan's voice in her 
mind as they both disappeared. 


I'll come for you later. Wait for me. 


She wished she could answer with her own thoughts. She also noticed something. 
Stefan's mental voice was much weaker than it had been four days ago when he had 
been fighting his brother. Come to think of it, he hadn't been able to speak with his 
mind at all before the Founders' Day celebration. She'd been so confused when she 
woke up by the river that it hadn't occurred to her, but now she wondered. What had 
happened to make him so strong? And why was his strength fading now? 


Elena had time to think about it as she sat there in the deserted choir loft, while 
below the people left the church and outside the overcast skies slowly grew darker. 
She thought about Stefan, and about Damon, and she wondered if she had made the 
right choice. She'd vowed never to let them fight over her, but that vow was broken 
already. Was she crazy to try and make them live under a truce, even a temporary 
one? 


When the sky outside was uniformly black, she ventured down the stairs. The 
church was empty and echoing. She hadn't thought about how she would get out, 
but fortunately the side door was bolted only from the inside. She slipped out into 
the night gratefully. 


She hadn't realized how good it was to be outside and in the dark. Being inside 
buildings made her feel trapped, and daylight hurt her eyes. This was best, free and 
unfettered-and unseen. Her own senses rejoiced at the lush world around her. With 
the air so still, scents hung in the air for a long time, and she could smell a whole 
plethora of nocturnal creatures. A fox was scavenging in somebody's trash. Brown 
rats were chewing something in the bushes. Night moths were calling to one another 
with scent. 


She found it wasn't hard to get to Meredith's house undetected; people seemed to 
be staying inside. But once she got there, she stood looking up at the graceful 
farmhouse with the screened porch in dismay. She couldn't just walk up to the front 
door and knock. Was Meredith really expecting her? Wouldn't she be waiting 
outside if she were? 


Meredith was about to get a terrible shock if she weren't, Elena reflected, eyeing 
the distance to the roof of the porch. Meredith's bedroom window was above it and 
just around the corner. It would be a bit of a reach, but Elena thought she could 
make it. 


Getting onto the roof was easy; her fingers and bare toes found holds between the 


Page 40 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
bricks and sent her sailing up. But leaning around the corner to look into Meredith's 
window was a strain. She blinked against the light that flooded out. 


Meredith was sitting on the edge of her bed, elbows on knees, staring at nothing. 
Every so often she ran a hand through her dark hair. A clock on the nightstand said 

Meredith was sitting on the edge of her bed, elbows on knees, staring at nothing. 
Every so often she ran a hand through her dark hair. A clock on the nightstand said 
Elena tapped on the window glass with her fingernails. 

Meredith jumped and looked the wrong way, toward the door. She stood up in a 
defensive crouch, clutching a throw pillow in one hand. When the door didn't open, 
she sidled a pace or two toward it, still in a defensive posture. "Who is it?" she said. 

Elena tapped on the glass again. 

Meredith spun to face the window, her breath coming fast. 

"Let me in," said Elena. She didn't know if Meredith could hear her, so she 
mouthed it clearly. "Open the window." 

Meredith, panting, looked around the room as if she expected someone to appear 
and help her. When no one did, she approached the window as if it were a 
dangerous animal. But she didn't open it. 

"Let me in," Elena said again. Then she added impatiently, "If you didn't want me 
to come, why did you make an appointment with me?" 

She saw the change as Meredith's shoulders relaxed slightly. Slowly, with fingers 
that were unusually clumsy, Meredith opened the window and stood back. 

"Now ask me to come inside. Otherwise I can't. 

"Come..." Meredith's voice failed and she had to try again. "Come in," she said. 
When Elena, wincing, had boosted herself over the sill and was flexing her cramped 
fingers, Meredith added almost dazedly, "It's got to be you. Nobody else gives 
orders like that." 

"It's me," Elena said. She stopped wringing out the cramps and looked into the 
eyes of her friend. "It really is me, Meredith," she said. 

Meredith nodded and swallowed visibly. Right then what Elena would have liked 
most in the world would have been for the other girl to give her a hug. But Meredith 
wasn't much of the hugging type, and right now she was backing slowly away to sit 
on the bed again. 

"Sit down," she said in an artificially calm voice. Elena pulled out the desk chair 
and unthinkingly took up the same position Meredith had been in before, elbows on 
knees, head down. Then she looked up. "How did you know?" 

Page 41 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
"I..." Meredith just stared at her for a moment, then shook herself. "Well. You-
your body was never found, of course. That was strange. And then those attacks on 
the old man and Vickie and Tanner-and Stefan and little things I'd put together 
about him-but I didn't know. Not for sure. Not until now." She ended almost in a 
whisper. 


"Well, it was a good guess," Elena said. She was trying to behave normally, but 
what was normal in this situation? Meredith was acting as if she could scarcely bear 
to look at her. It made Elena feel more lonely, more alone, than she could ever

remember being in her life. 


"I asked Bonnie to come over at seven o'clock, if her mother would let her. It's 
probably her. I'll go see." Meredith seemed almost indecently eager to get away. 


"Wait. Does she know?" 


"No... Oh, you mean I should break it to her gently." Meredith looked around the 
room again uncertainly, and Elena snapped on the little reading light by the bed. 


"Turn the room light off. It hurts my eyes anyway," she said quietly. When 
Meredith did, the bedroom was dim enough that she could conceal herself in the 
shadows. 


Waiting for Meredith to return with Bonnie, she stood in a corner, hugging her 
elbows with her hands. Maybe it was a bad idea trying to get Meredith and Bonnie 
involved. If imperturbable Meredith couldn't handle the situation, what would Bonnie 
do? 


Meredith heralded their arrival by muttering over and over, "Don't scream now; 
don't scream," as she bundled Bonnie across the threshold. 


"What's wrong with you? What are you doing?" Bonnie was gasping in return. 
"Let go of me. Do you know what I had to do to get my mother to let me out of the 
house tonight? She wants to take me to the hospital at Roanoke." 


Meredith kicked the door shut. "Okay," she said to Bonnie. "Now, you're going 
to see something that will... well, it's going to be a shock. But you can't scream, do 
you understand me? I'll let go of you if you promise." 


"It's too dark to see anything, and you're scaring me. What's wrong with you, 
Meredith? Oh, all right, I promise, but what are you talking-" 


"Elena," said Meredith. Elena took it as an invitation and stepped forward. 


Bonnie's reaction wasn't what she expected. She frowned and leaned forward, 
peering in the dim light. When she saw Elena's form, she gasped. But then, as she 
stared at Elena's face, she clapped her hands together with a shriek of joy.

"I knew it! I knew they were wrong! So there, Meredith-and you and Stefan 
thought you knew so much about drowning and all that. But I knew you were wrong! 
Oh, Elena, I missed you! Everyone's going to be so-" 


"Be quiet, Bonnie! Be quiet!" Meredith said urgently. "I told you not to scream. 
Listen, you idiot, do you think if Elena were really all right she'd be here in the 
middle of the night without anybody knowing about it?" 


"But she is all right; look at her. She's standing there. It is you, isn't it, Elena?" 
Bonnie started toward her, but Meredith grabbed her again. 


"Yes, it's me." Elena had the strange feeling she'd wandered into a surreal 
comedy, maybe one written by Kafka, only she didn't know her lines. She didn't

know what to say to Bonnie, who was looking rapturous. 


"What are you two being so mysterious for? She's here, but she's not all right. 
What's that supposed to mean?" 


Elena didn't know whether to laugh or cry. "Look, Bonnie... oh, I don't know 
how to say this. Bonnie, did your psychic grandmother ever talk to you about 
vampires?" 


Silence fell, heavy as an ax. The minutes ticked by. Impossibly, Bonnie's eyes 
widened still further; then, they slid toward Meredith. There were several more 
minutes of silence, and then Bonnie shifted her weight toward the door. "Uh, look, 
you guys," she said softly, "this is getting really weird. I mean, really, really, really... 
" 


Elena cast about in her mind. "You can look at my teeth," she said. She pulled her 
upper lip back, poking at a canine with her finger. She felt the reflexive lengthening 
and sharpening, like a cat's claw lazily extending. 


Meredith came forward and looked and then looked away quickly. "I get the 
point," she said, but in her voice there was none of the old wry pleasure in her own 
wit. "Bonnie, look," she said. 


All the elation, all the excitement had drained out of Bonnie. She looked as if she 
were going to be sick. "No. I don't want to." 


"You have to. You have to believe it, or we'll never get anywhere." Meredith 
grappled a stiff and resisting Bonnie forward. "Open your eyes, you little twit. 
You're the one who loves all this supernatural stuff." 


"I've changed my mind," Bonnie said, almost sobbing. There was genuine 
hysteria in her tone. "Leave me alone, Meredith; I don't want to look." She 
wrenched herself away. 


Page 43 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
"You don't have to," Elena whispered, stunned. Dismay pooled inside her, and 
tears flooded her eyes. "This was a bad idea, Meredith. I'll go away." 

"No. Oh, don't." Bonnie turned back as quickly as she'd whirled away and 
precipitated herself into Elena's arms. "I'm sorry, Elena; I'm sorry. I don't care what 
you are; I'm just glad you're back. It's been terrible without you." She was sobbing 
now in earnest. 

The tears that wouldn't come when Elena had been with Stefan came now. She 
cried, holding on to Bonnie, feeling Meredith's arms go around both of them. They 
were all crying-Meredith silently, Bonnie noisily, and Elena herself with passionate 
intensity. She felt as if she were crying for everything that had happened to her, for 
everything she had lost, for all the loneliness and the fear and the pain. 

Eventually, they all ended up sitting on the floor, knee to knee, the way they had 
when they were kids at a sleepover making secret plans. 


"You're so brave," Bonnie said to Elena, sniffling. "I don't see how you can be so 
brave about it." 

"You're so brave," Bonnie said to Elena, sniffling. "I don't see how you can be so 
brave about it." 

"Your hands aren't cold." Meredith squeezed Elena's fingers. "Just sort of cool. I 
thought they'd be colder." 

"Stefan's hands aren't cold either," Elena said, and she was about to go on, but 
Bonnie squeaked: "Stefan?" 

Meredith and Elena looked at her. 

"Be sensible, Bonnie. You don't get to be a vampire by yourself. Somebody has 
to make you one." 

"But you mean Stefan . . . ? You mean he's a... ?" Bonnie's voice choked off. 

"I think," said Meredith, "that maybe this is the time to tell us the whole story, 
Elena. Like all those minor details you left out the last time we asked you for the 
whole story." 

Elena nodded. "You're right. It's hard to explain, but I'll try." She took a deep 
breath. "Bonnie, do you remember the first day of school? It was the first time I ever 
heard you make a prophecy. You looked into my palm and said I'd meet a boy, a 
dark boy, a stranger. And that he wasn't tall but that he had been once. Well"-she 
looked at Bonnie and then at Meredith-"Stefan's not really tall now. But he was 
once... compared to other people in the fifteenth century." 

Meredith nodded, but Bonnie made a faint sound and swayed backward, looking 
shell-shocked. "You mean-" 

Page 44 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
"I mean he lived in Renaissance Italy, and the average person was shorter then. 
So Stefan looked taller by comparison. And, wait, before you pass out, here's 
something else you should know. Damon's his brother." 

Meredith nodded again. "I figured something like that. But then why has Damon 
been saying he's a college student?" 

"They don't get along very well. For a long time, Stefan didn't even know Damon 
was in Fell's Church." Elena faltered. She was verging on Stefan's private history, 
which she'd always felt was his secret to tell. But Meredith had been right; it was 
time to come out with the whole story. "Listen, it was like this," she said. "Stefan 
and Damon were both in love with the same girl back in Renaissance Italy. She was 
from Germany, and her name was Katherine. The reason Stefan was avoiding me at 
the beginning of school was that I reminded him of her; she had blond hair and blue 
eyes, too. Oh, and this was her ring." Elena let go of Meredith's hand and showed 
them the intricately carved golden circlet set with a single stone of lapis lazuli. 

"And the thing was that Katherine was a vampire. A guy named Klaus had made 
her one back in her village in Germany to save her from dying of her last illness. 
Stefan and Damon both knew this, but they didn't care. They asked her to choose 


between them the one she wanted to marry." Elena stopped and gave a lopsided 
smile, thinking that Mr. Tanner had been right; history did repeat itself. She only 
hoped her story didn't end like Katherine's. "But she chose both of them. She 
exchanged blood with both of them, and she said they could all three be companions 
through eternity." 

between them the one she wanted to marry." Elena stopped and gave a lopsided

hoped her story didn't end like Katherine's. "But she chose both of them. She 
exchanged blood with both of them, and she said they could all three be companions 
through eternity." 

"Sounds dumb," said Meredith. 

"You got it," Elena told her. "Katherine was sweet but not very bright. Stefan and 
Damon already didn't like each other. They told her she had to choose, that they 
wouldn't even think of sharing her. And she ran off crying. The next day-well, they 
found her body, or what was left of it. See, a vampire needs a talisman like this ring 
to go out in the sun without being killed. And Katherine went out in the sun and took 
hers off. She thought if she were out of the way, Damon and Stefan would be 
reconciled." 

"Oh, my God, how ro-" 

"No, it isn't," Elena cut Bonnie off savagely. "It's not romantic at all. Stefan's 
been living with the guilt ever since, and I think Damon has, too, although you'd 
never get him to admit it. And the immediate result was that they got a couple of 
swords and killed each other. Yes, killed. That's why they're vampires now, and 

Page 45 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
that's why they hate each other so much. And that's why I'm probably crazy trying 
to get them to cooperate now." 


Seven 

"To cooperate at what?" Meredith asked. 

"I'll explain about that later. But first I want to know what's been going on in town 
since I-left." 

"Well, hysteria mostly," Meredith said, raising an eyebrow. "Your Aunt Judith's 
been pretty badly off. She hallucinated that she saw you-only it wasn't a 
hallucination, was it? And she and Robert have sort of broken up." 

"I know," Elena said grimly. "Go on." 

"Everybody at school is upset. I wanted to talk to Stefan, especially when I began 
to suspect you weren't really dead, but he hasn't been at school. Matt has been, but 
there's something wrong with him. He looks like a zombie, and he won't talk to 
anyone. I wanted to explain to him that there was a chance you might not be gone 
forever; I thought that would cheer him up. But he wouldn't listen. He was acting 
totally out of character, and at one point I thought he was going to hit me. He 
wouldn't listen to a word." 

"Oh, God-Matt." Something terrible was stirring at the bottom of Elena's mind, 
some memory too disturbing to be let loose. She couldn't cope with anything more 
just now, she couldn't, she thought, and slam dunked the memory back down. 

Meredith was going on. "It's clear, though, that some other people are suspicious 
about your 'death.' That's why I said what I did in the memorial service; I was afraid 
if I said the real day and place that Alaric Saltzman would end up ambushing you 
outside the house. He's been asking all sorts of questions, and it's a good thing 
Bonnie didn't know anything she could blab." 

"That isn't fair," Bonnie protested. "Alaric's just interested, that's all, and he wants 
to help us through the trauma, like before. He's an Aquarius-" 

"He's a spy," said Elena, "and maybe more than that. But we'll talk about that 
later. What about Tyler Smallwood? I didn't see him at the service." 

Meredith looked nonplussed. "You mean you don't know?" 

"I don't know anything; I've been asleep for four days in an attic." 

"Well..." Meredith paused uneasily. "Tyler just got back from the hospital. Same 
with Dick Carter and those four tough guys they had along with them on Founders' 
Day. They were attacked in the Quonset hut that evening and they lost a lot of 
blood." 

Page 46 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
"Oh." The mystery of why Stefan's Powers had been so much stronger that night 
was explained. And why they'd been getting weaker ever since. He probably hadn't 
eaten since then. "Meredith, is Stefan a suspect?" 

"Well, Tyler's father tried to make him one, but the police couldn't make the times 
work out. They know approximately when Tyler was attacked because he was 


supposed to meet Mr. Smallwood, and he didn't show up. And Bonnie and I can 
alibi Stefan for that time because we'd just left him by the river with your body. So 
he couldn't have gotten back to the Quonset hut to attack Tyler-at least no normal 
human could. And so far the police aren't thinking about anything supernatural."

he couldn't have gotten back to the Quonset hut to attack Tyler-at least no normal 
human could. And so far the police aren't thinking about anything supernatural." 

"Tyler and those guys can't identify the attacker because they can't remember a 
thing about that afternoon," Meredith added. "Neither can Caroline." 

"Caroline was in there?" 

"Yes, but she wasn't bitten. Just in shock. In spite of everything she's done, I 
almost feel sorry for her." Meredith shrugged and added, "She looks pretty pathetic 
these days." 

"And I don't think anyone will ever suspect Stefan after what happened with those 
dogs at church today," Bonnie put in. "My dad says that a big dog could have 
broken the window in the Quonset hut, and the wounds in Tyler's throat looked sort 
of like animal wounds. I think a lot of people believe it was a dog or a pack of dogs 
that did it." 

"It's a convenient explanation," Meredith said dryly. "It means they don't have to 
think any more about it." 

"But that's ridiculous," said Elena. "Normal dogs don't behave that way. Aren't 
people wondering about why their dogs would suddenly go mad and turn on them?" 

"Lots of people are just getting rid of them. Oh, and I heard someone talk about 
mandatory rabies testing," Meredith said. "But it's not just rabies, is it, Elena?" 

"No, I don't think so. And neither do Stefan or Damon. And that's what I came 
over to talk to you about." Elena explained, as clearly as she could, what she had 
been thinking about the Other Power in Fell's Church. She told about the force that 
had chased her off the bridge and about the feeling she'd had with the dogs and 
about everything she and Stefan and Damon had discussed. She finished with, "And 
Bonnie said it herself in church today: 'Something evil.' I think that's what's here in 
Fell's Church, something nobody knows about, something completely evil. I don't 
suppose you know what you meant by that, Bonnie." 

Page 47 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
But Bonnie's mind was running on another track. "So Damon didn't necessarily 
do all those awful things you said he did," she said shrewdly. "Like killing Yangtze 
and hurting Vickie and murdering Mr. Tanner, and all. I told you nobody that 
gorgeous could be a psycho killer." 


"I think," said Meredith with a glance at Elena, "that you had better forget about 
Damon as a love interest." 


"Yes," said Elena emphatically. "He did kill Mr. Tanner, Bonnie. And it stands to 
reason he did the other attacks, too; I'll ask him about that. And I'm having enough 
trouble dealing with him myself. You don't want to mess with him, Bonnie, believe 
me." 


. 
"I'm supposed to leave Damon alone; I'm supposed to leave Alaric alone... Are 
there any guys I'm not supposed to leave alone? And meanwhile Elena gets them all. 
It's not fair." 


"I'm supposed to leave Damon alone; I'm supposed to leave Alaric alone... Are 
there any guys I'm not supposed to leave alone? And meanwhile Elena gets them all. 
It's not fair." 


"I don't know. Something tremendously strong-but it could be shielding itself so 
that we can't sense it. It could look like an ordinary person. And that's why I came 
for your help, because it could be anybody in Fell's Church. It's like what Bonnie 
said during the service today: 'Nobody is what they seem.' " 


Bonnie looked forlorn. "I don't remember saying that." 


"You said it, all right. 'Nobody is what they seem,' " Elena quoted again weightily. 
"Nobody." She glanced at Meredith, but the dark eyes under the elegantly arched 
eyebrows were calm and distant. 


"Well, that would seem to make everybody a suspect," Meredith said in her most 
unruffled voice. "Right?" 


"Right," said Elena. "But we'd better get a note pad and pencil and make a list of 
the most important ones. Damon and Stefan have already agreed to help investigate, 
and if you'll help, too, we'll stand an even better chance of finding it." She was 
hitting her stride with this; she'd always been good at organizing things, from 
schemes to get boys to fundraising events. This was just a more serious version of 
the old plan A and plan B. 


Meredith gave the pencil and paper to Bonnie, who looked at it. and then at 
Meredith, and then at Elena. "Fine," she said, "but who goes on the list?" 


"Well, anyone we have reason to suspect of being the Other Power. Anyone who 
might have done the things we know it did: seal Stefan in the well, chase me, set 
those dogs on people. Anyone we've noticed behaving oddly." 


"Matt," said Bonnie, writing busily. "And Vickie. And Robert." 


Page 48 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
"Bonnie!" exclaimed Elena and Meredith simultaneously. 


Bonnie looked up. "Well, Matt has been acting oddly, and so has Vickie, for 
months now. And Robert was hanging around outside the church before the service, 
but he never came in-" 


"Oh, Bonnie, honestly," Meredith said. "Vickie's a victim, not a suspect. And if 
Matt's an evil Power, I'm the hunchback of Notre Dame. And as for Robert-" 


"Fine, I've crossed it all out," said Bonnie coldly. "Now let's hear your ideas." 


"No, wait," Elena said. "Bonnie, wait a moment." She was thinking about 
something, something that had been nagging at her for quite a while, ever since-
"Ever since the church," she said aloud, remembering it. "Do you know, I saw 
Robert outside the church, too, when I was hidden in the choir loft. It was just 
before the dogs attacked, and he was sort of backing away like he knew what was 
going to happen." 


. 
"Oh, but Elena-" 


"Oh, but Elena-" 


Soberly, after a moment's hesitation, Bonnie did. "Who else?" she said. 


"Well, Alaric, I'm afraid," Elena said. "I'm sorry, Bonnie, but he's practically 
number one." She told what she had overheard that morning between Alaric and the 
principal. "He isn't a normal history teacher; they called him here for some reason. 
He knows I'm a vampire, and he's looking for me. And today, while the dogs were 
attacking, he was standing there on the sidelines making some kind of weird 
gestures. He's definitely not what he seems, and the only question is: what is he? Are 
you listening, Meredith?" 


"Yes. You know, I think you should put Mrs. Flowers on that list. Remember the 
way she stood at the window of the boarding-house when we were bringing Stefan 
back from the well? But she wouldn't come downstairs to open the door for us? 
That's odd behavior." 


Elena nodded. "Yes, and how she kept hanging up on me when I called him. And 
she certainly keeps to herself in that old house. She may just be a dotty old lady, but 
put her down anyway, Bonnie." She ran a hand through her hair, lifting it off the 
back of her neck. She was hot. Or-not hot exactly, but uncomfortable in some way 
that was similar to being overheated. She felt parched. 


"All right, we'll go by the boardinghouse tomorrow before school," Meredith 
said. "Meanwhile, what else can we be doing? Let's have a look at that list, Bonnie." 


Bonnie held the list out so they could see it, and Elena and Meredith leaned 
forward and read: 


Page 49 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
Matt Honeycutt 

Vickie Bennett 

Robert Maxwell-What was he doing at the church when the dogs attacked? And 
what was going on that night with Elena's aunt? 

Alaric Saltzman-Why does he ask so many questions? What was he called to 
Fell's Church to do? 

Mrs. Flowers-Why does she act so strange? 

Why didn't she let us in the night Stefan was wounded? 

"Good," Elena said. "I guess we could also find out whose dogs were at the 
church today. And you can watch Alaric at school tomorrow." 

"I'll watch Alaric," Bonnie said firmly. "And I'll get him cleared of suspicion; you 
see if I don't." 


"Fine, you do that. You can be assigned to him. And Meredith can investigate 
Mrs. Flowers, and I can take Robert. And as for Stefan and Damon-well, they can 
be assigned to everyone, because they can use their Powers to probe people's 
minds. Besides, that list is by no means complete. I'm going to ask them to scout 
around town searching for any signs of Power, or anything else weird going on. 
They're more likely than I am to recognize it." 

"Fine, you do that. You can be assigned to him. And Meredith can investigate 
Mrs. Flowers, and I can take Robert. And as for Stefan and Damon-well, they can

around town searching for any signs of Power, or anything else weird going on. 
They're more likely than I am to recognize it." 

"Elena. Elena!" 

Startled, Elena looked up, to see Meredith's wary dark eyes and Bonnie's alarmed 
expression. It was only then that she realized she was crouched close to Bonnie's 
wrist, rubbing the biggest vein with her finger. 

"Sorry," she murmured, sitting back. But she could feel the extra length and 
sharpness of her canine teeth. It was something like wearing braces; she could 
clearly feel the difference in weight. She realized her reassuring smile at Bonnie was 
not having the desired effect. Bonnie was looking scared, which was silly. Bonnie 
ought to know that Elena would never hurt her. And Elena wasn't very hungry 
tonight; Elena had always been a light eater. She could get all she needed from this 
tiny vein here in the wrist... 

Elena jumped to her feet and spun toward the window, leaning against the casing, 
feeling the cool night air blowing on her skin. She felt dizzy, and she couldn't seem 

Page 50 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
to get her breath. 


What had she been doing? She turned around to see Bonnie huddled close to 
Meredith, both of them looking sick with fear. She hated having them look at her that 
way. 


"I'm sorry," she said. "I didn't mean to, Bonnie. Look, I'm not coming any closer. 
I should have eaten before I came here. Damon said I'd get hungry later." 


Bonnie swallowed, looking even sicker. "Eaten?" 


"Yes, of course," Elena said tartly. Her veins were burning; that was what this 
feeling was. Stefan had described it before, but she'd never really understood; she'd 
never realized what he was going through when the need for blood was on him. It 
was terrible, irresistible. "What do you think I eat these days, air?" she added 
defiantly. "I'm a hunter now, and I'd better go out hunting." 


Bonnie and Meredith were trying to cope; she could tell they were, but she could 
also see the revulsion in their eyes. She concentrated on using her new senses, in 
opening herself to the night and searching for Stefan's or Damon's presence. It was 
difficult, because neither of them was projecting with his mind as he had been the 
night they'd been fighting in the woods, but she thought she could sense a glimmer 


. 
of Power out there in the town. 


of Power out there in the town. 


When the bulb was finally screwed back in, it revealed Damon sitting casually but 
precariously on the sill of the open window, one knee up. He was smiling one of his 
wildest smiles. 


"Do you mind?" he said. "This is uncomfortable." 


Elena glanced back at Bonnie and Meredith, who were braced against the closet, 
looking horrified and hypnotized at once. She herself shook her head, exasperated. 


"And I thought I liked to make a dramatic entrance," she said. "Very funny, 
Damon. Now let's go." 


"With two such beautiful friends of yours right here?" Damon smiled again at 
Bonnie and Meredith. "Besides, I only just got here. Won't somebody be polite and 
ask me in?" 


Bonnie's brown eyes, fixed helplessly on his face, softened a bit. Her lips, which 
had been parted in horror, parted further. Elena recognized the signs of imminent 
meltdown. 


"No, they won't," she said. She put herself directly between Damon and the other 
girls. "Nobody here is for you, Damon-not now, not ever." Seeing the flare of 
challenge in his eyes, she added archly, "And anyway, I'm leaving. I don't know 


Page 51 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
about you, but I'm going hunting." She was reassured to sense Stefan's presence 
nearby, on the roof probably, and to hear his instant amendment: We're going 
hunting, Damon. You can sit there all night if you want. 

Damon gave in with good grace, shooting one last amused glance toward Bonnie 
before disappearing from the window. Bonnie and Meredith both started forward in 
alarm as he did, obviously concerned that he had just fallen to his death. 

"He's fine," said Elena, shaking her head again. "And don't worry, I won't let him 

come back. I'll meet you at the same time tomorrow. Good-bye." 
"But-Elena-" Meredith stopped. "I mean, I was going to ask you if you wanted 
to change your clothes." 

Elena regarded herself. The nineteenth-century heirloom dress was tattered and 
bedraggled, the thin white muslin shredded in some places. But there was no time to 
change it; she had to feed now. 

"It'll have to wait," she said. "See you tomorrow." And she boosted herself out of 

the window the way Damon had. The last she saw of them, Meredith and Bonnie 
. 
were staring after her dazedly. 


were staring after her dazedly. 
"Your cloak," she said, pleased. For a moment they smiled at each other, 
remembering the first time he had given her the cloak, after he'd saved her from Tyler 


in the graveyard and taken her back to his room to clean up. He'd been afraid to 
touch her then. But, Elena thought, smiling up into his eyes, she had taken care of 
that fear rather quickly. 
"I thought we were hunting," Damon said. 
Elena turned the smile on him, without unlinking her hand from Stefan's. "We 
are," she said. "Where should we go?" 
"Any house on this street," Damon suggested. 
"The woods," Stefan said. 
"The woods," Elena decided. "We don't touch humans, and we don't kill. Isn't 
that how it goes, Stefan?" 
He returned the pressure of her fingers. "That's how it goes," he said quietly. 
Damon's lip curled fastidiously. "And just what are we looking for in the woods, 


Page 52 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
or don't I want to know? Muskrat? Skunk? Termites?" His eyes moved to Elena and 
his voice dropped. "Come with me, and I'll show you some real hunting." 

"We can go through the graveyard," Elena said, ignoring him. 

"White-tailed deer feed all night in the open areas," Stefan told her, "but we'll have 
to be careful stalking them; they can hear almost as well as we can." 

Another time, then, Damon's voice said in Elena's mind. 


Eight 

"Who-? Oh, it's you!" Bonnie said, starting at the touch on her elbow. "You 
scared me. I didn't hear you come up." 

He'd have to be more careful, Stefan realized. In the few days he'd been away 
from school, he'd gotten out of the habit of walking and moving like a human and 
fallen back into the noiseless, perfectly controlled stride of the hunter. "Sorry," he 
said, as they walked side by side down the corridor. 

"S'okay," said Bonnie with a brave attempt at nonchalance. But her brown eyes 
were wide and rather fixed. "So what are you doing here today? Meredith and I came 
by the boardinghouse this morning to check on Mrs. Flowers, but nobody answered 
the door. And I didn't see you in biology." 

"I came this afternoon. I'm back at school. For as long as it takes to find what 
we're looking for anyway." 

"To spy on Alaric, you mean," Bonnie muttered. "I told Elena yesterday just to 
leave him to me. Oops," she added, as a couple of passing juniors stared at her. She 
rolled her eyes at Stefan. By mutual consent, they turned off into a side corridor and 
made for an empty stairwell. Bonnie leaned against the wall with a groan of relief. 

"I've got to remember not to say her name," she said pathetically, "but it's so 
hard. My mother asked me how I felt this morning and I almost told her, 'fine,' since 
I saw Elena last night. I don't know how you two kept-you know what-a secret 
so long." 

Stefan felt a grin tugging at his lips in spite of himself. Bonnie was like a 
six-week-old kitten, all charm and no inhibitions. She always said exactly what she 
was thinking at the moment, even if it completely contradicted what she'd just said 
the moment before, but everything she did came from the heart. "You're standing in 
a deserted hallway with a you know what right now," he reminded her devilishly. 

"Ohhh." Her eyes widened again. "But you wouldn't, would you?" she added, 
relieved. "Because Elena would kill you... Oh, dear." Searching for another topic, 
she gulped and said, "So-so how did things go last night?" 

Stefan's mood darkened immediately. "Not so good. Oh, Elena's all right; she's

sleeping safely." Before he could go on, his ears picked up footfalls at the end of the 
corridor. Three senior girls were passing by, and one broke away from the group at 
the sight of Stefan and Bonnie. Sue Carson's face was pale and her eyes were 
red-rimmed, but she smiled at them. 

Bonnie was full of concern. "Sue, how are you? How's Doug?" 

"I'm okay. He's okay, too, or at least he's going to be. Stefan, I wanted to talk to 
you," she added in a rush. "I know my dad thanked you yesterday for helping Doug 
the way you did, but I wanted to thank you, too. I mean, I know that people in town 
have been pretty horrible to you and-well, I'm just surprised you cared enough to 


help at all. But I'm glad. My mom says you saved Doug's life. And so, I just wanted 
to thank you, and to say I'm sorry-about everything." 

help at all. But I'm glad. My mom says you saved Doug's life. And so, I just wanted 
to thank you, and to say I'm sorry-about everything." 

"That's all right," he said. "How's Chelsea today?" 

"She's at the pound. They're holding the dogs in quarantine there, all the ones they 
could round up." Sue blotted her eyes and straightened, and Stefan relaxed, seeing 
that the danger was over. An awkward silence descended. 

"Well," said Bonnie to Sue at last, "have you heard what the school board 
decided about the Snow Dance?" 

"I heard they met this morning and they've pretty much decided to let us have it. 
Somebody said they were talking about a police guard, though. Oh, there's the late 
bell. We'd better get to history before Alaric hands us all demerits." 

"We're coming in a minute," Stefan said. He added casually, "When is this Snow 
Dance?" 

"It's the thirteenth; Friday night, you know," Sue said, and then winced. "Oh my 
God, Friday the thirteenth. I didn't even think about that. But it reminds me that there 
was one other thing I wanted to tell you. This morning I took my name out of the 
running for snow queen. It-it just seemed right, somehow. That's all." Sue hurried 
away, almost running. 

Stefan's mind was racing. "Bonnie, what is this Snow Dance?" 

"Well, it's the Christmas dance really, only we have a snow queen instead of a 
Christmas queen. After what happened at Founders' Day, they were thinking of 
canceling it, and then with the dogs yesterday-but it sounds like they're going to 
have it after all." 

"On Friday the thirteenth," Stefan said grimly. 

"Yes." Bonnie was looking scared again, making herself small and inconspicuous. 

Page 54 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
"Stefan, don't look that way; you're frightening me. What's wrong? What do you 
think will happen at the dance?" 

"I don't know." But something would, Stefan was thinking. Fell's Church hadn't 
had one public celebration that had escaped being visited by the Other Power, and 
this would probably be the last festivity of the year. But there was no point in talking 
about it now. "Come on," he said. "We're really late." 

He was right. Alaric Saltzman was at the chalkboard when they walked in, as he 
had been the first day he'd appeared in the history classroom. If he was surprised at 
seeing them late, or at all, he covered it faultlessly, giving one of his friendliest 
smiles. 

So you're the one who's hunting the hunter, Stefan thought, taking his seat and 


studying the man before him. But are you anything more than that? Elena's Other 
Power maybe? 

studying the man before him. But are you anything more than that? Elena's Other 
Power maybe? 

Elena. Stefan's hand clenched under his desk, and a slow ache woke in his chest. 
He hadn't meant to think about her. The only way he had gotten through the last five 
days was by keeping her at the edge of his mind, not letting her image any closer. 
But then of course the effort of holding her away at a safe distance took up most of 
his time and energy. And this was the worst place of all to be, in a classroom where 
he couldn't care less about what was being taught. There was nothing to do but think 
here. 

He made himself breathe slowly, calmly. She was well; that was the important 
thing. Nothing else really mattered. But even as he told himself this, jealousy bit into 
him like the thongs of a whip. Because whenever he thought about Elena now, he 
had to think about him. 

About Damon, who was free to come and go as he liked. Who might even be 
with Elena this minute. 

Anger burned in Stefan's mind, bright and cold, mingling with the hot ache in his 
chest. He still wasn't convinced that Damon wasn't the one who had casually thrown 
him, bleeding and unconscious, into an abandoned well shaft to die. And he would 
take Elena's idea about the Other Power much more seriously if he was completely 
sure that Damon hadn't chased Elena to her death. Damon was evil; he had no mercy 
and no scruples... 

And what's he done that I haven't done? Stefan asked himself heavily, for the 
hundredth time. Nothing. 

Except kill. 

Stefan had tried to kill. He'd meant to kill Tyler. At the memory, the cold fire of 

Page 55 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
his anger toward Damon was doused, and he glanced instead toward a desk at the 
back of the room. 

It was empty. Though Tyler had gotten out of the hospital the day before, he 
hadn't returned to school. Still, there should be no danger of his remembering 
anything from that grisly afternoon. The subliminal suggestion to forget should hold 
for quite a while, as long as no one messed with Tyler's mind. 

He suddenly became aware that he was staring at Tyler's empty desk with narrow, 
brooding eyes. As he looked away, he caught the glance of someone who'd been 
watching him do it. 

Matt turned quickly and bent over his history book, but not before Stefan saw his 


expression. 

expression. 

December 5-I don't know what time, probably early afternoon. 

Dear Diary, 

Damon got you back for me this morning. Stefan said he didn't want me going 
into Alaric's attic again. This is Stefan's pen I'm using. I don't own anything 
anymore, or at least I can't get at any of my own things, and most of them Aunt 
Judith would miss if I took them. I'm sitting right now in a barn behind the 
boardinghouse. I can't go where people sleep, you know, unless I've been invited 
in. I guess animals don't count, because there are some rats sleeping here under 
the hay and an owl in the rafters. At the moment, we're ignoring each other. 

I'm trying very hard not to have hysterics. 

I thought writing might help. Something normal, something familiar. Except 
that nothing in my life is normal anymore. 

Damon says I'll get used to it faster if I throw my old life away and embrace the 
new one. He seems to think it's inevitable that I turn out like him. He says I was 
born to be a hunter and there's no point in doing things halfway. 

I hunted a deer last night. A stag, because it was making the most noise, 
clashing its antlers against tree branches, challenging other males. I drank its 
blood. 

When I look over this diary, all I can see is that I was searching for something, 
for someplace to belong. But this isn't it. This new life isn't it. I'm afraid of what 
I'll become if I do start to belong here. 

Oh, God, I'm frightened. 

The barn owl is almost pure white, especially when it spreads its wings so you 

Page 56 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
can see the underside. From the back it looks more gold. It has just a little gold 
around the face. It's staring at me right now because I'm making noises, trying not 
to cry. 

It's funny that I can still cry. I guess it's witches that can't. 

It's started snowing outside. I'm pulling my cloak up around me. 

Elena tucked the little book close to her body and drew the soft dark velvet of the 
cloak up to her chin. The barn was utterly silent, except for the minute breathing of 
the animals that slept there. Outside the snow drifted down just as soundlessly, 
blanketing the world in muffling stillness. Elena stared at it with unseeing eyes, 
scarcely noticing the tears that ran down her cheeks. 

"And could Bonnie McCullough and Caroline Forbes please stay after class a 
moment," Alaric said as the last bell rang. 


Stefan frowned, a frown that deepened as he saw Vickie Bennett hovering outside 
the open door of the history room, her eyes shy and frightened. "I'll be right 
outside," he said meaningfully to Bonnie, who nodded. He added a warning lift of 
his eyebrows, and she responded with a virtuous look. Catch me saying anything I'm 
not supposed to, the look said. 

Stefan frowned, a frown that deepened as he saw Vickie Bennett hovering outside 
the open door of the history room, her eyes shy and frightened. "I'll be right

his eyebrows, and she responded with a virtuous look. Catch me saying anything I'm 
not supposed to, the look said. 

Vickie Bennett was entering as he exited, and he had to step out of her way. But 
that took him right into the path of Matt, who'd come out the other door and was 
trying to get down the corridor as fast as possible. 

Stefan grabbed his arm without thinking. "Matt, wait." 

"Let go of me." Matt's fist came up. He looked at it in apparent surprise, as if not 
sure what he should be so mad about. But every muscle in his body was fighting 
Stefan's grip. 

"I just want to talk to you. Just for a minute, all right?" 

"I don't have a minute," Matt said, and at last his eyes, a lighter, less complicated 
blue than Elena's, met Stefan's. But there was a blankness in the depths of them that 
reminded Stefan of the look of someone who'd been hypnotized, or who was under 
the influence of some Power. 

Only it was no Power except Matt's own mind, he realized abruptly. This was 
what the human brain did to itself when faced with something it simply couldn't deal 
with. Matt had shut down, turned off. 

Page 57 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
Testing, Stefan said, "About what happened Saturday night-" 


"I don't know what you're talking about. Look, I said I had to go, damn it." 
Denial was like a fortress behind Matt's eyes. But Stefan had to try again. 


"I don't blame you for being mad. If I were you, I'd be furious. And I know what 
it's like not to want to think, especially when thinking can drive you crazy." Matt was 
shaking his head, and Stefan looked around the hallway. It was almost empty, and 
desperation made him willing to take a risk. He lowered his voice. "But maybe you'd 
at least like to know that Elena's awake, and she's much-" 


"Elena's dead!" Matt shouted, drawing the attention of everyone in the corridor. 
"And I told you to let go of me!" he added, oblivious of their audience, and shoved 
Stefan hard. It was so unexpected that Stefan stumbled back against the lockers, 
almost ending up sprawled on the ground. He stared at Matt, but Matt never even 
glanced back as he took off down the hallway. 


Stefan spent the rest of the time until Bonnie emerged just staring at the wall. 
There was a poster there for the Snow Dance, and he knew every inch of it by the 
time the girls came out. 


Despite everything Caroline had tried to do to him and Elena, Stefan found he 
couldn't summon up any hatred of her. Her auburn hair looked faded, her face 
pinched. Instead of being willowy, her posture just looked wilted, he thought, 


. 
watching her go. 


watching her go. 


"Yes, of course. Alaric just knows we three-Vickie, Caroline, and I-have been 
through a lot, and he wants us to know that he supports us," Bonnie said, but even 
her dogged optimism about the history teacher sounded a little forced. "None of us 
told him about anything, though. He's having another get-together at his house next 
week," she added brightly. 


Wonderful, thought Stefan. Normally he might have said something about it, but 
at that moment he was distracted. "There's Meredith," he said. 


"She must be waiting for us-no, she's going down the history wing," Bonnie 
said. "That's funny, I told her I'd meet her out here." 


It was more than funny, thought Stefan. He'd caught only a glimpse of her as she 
turned the corner, but that glimpse stuck in his mind. The expression on Meredith's 
face had been calculating, watchful, and her step had been stealthy. As if she were 
trying to do something without being seen. 


"She'll come back in a minute when she sees we're not down there," Bonnie said, 
but Meredith didn't come back in a minute, or two, or three. In fact, it was almost 
ten minutes before she appeared, and then she looked startled to see Stefan and 
Bonnie waiting for her. 


Page 58 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
"Sorry, I got held up," she said coolly, and Stefan had to admire her 
self-possession. But he wondered what was behind it, and only Bonnie was in a 
mood to chat as the three of them left school. 

"But last time you used fire," Elena said. 

"That was because we were looking for Stefan, for a specific person," Bonnie 
replied. "This time we're trying to predict the future. If it was just your personal 
future I was trying to predict, I'd look in your palm, but we're trying to find out 
something general." 

Meredith entered the room, carefully balancing a china bowl full to the brim with 
water. In her other hand, she held a candle. "I've got the stuff," she said. 

"Water was sacred to the Druids," Bonnie explained, as Meredith placed the dish 
on the floor and the three girls sat around it. 

"Apparently, everything was sacred to the Druids," said Meredith. 

"Shh. Now, put the candle in the candlestick and light it. Then I'm going to pour 
melted wax into the water, and the shapes it makes will tell me the answers to your 
questions. My grandmother used melted lead, and she said her grandmother used 
melted silver, but she told me wax would do." When Meredith had lit the candle, 
Bonnie glanced at it sideways and took a deep breath. "I'm getting scareder and 
scareder to do this," she said. 

"You don't have to," Elena said softly. 


"I know. But I want to-this once. Besides, it's not these kind of rituals that scare 
me; it's getting taken over that's so awful. I hate it. It's like somebody else getting 
into my body." 

"I know. But I want to-this once. Besides, it's not these kind of rituals that scare 
me; it's getting taken over that's so awful. I hate it. It's like somebody else getting 
into my body." 

"Anyway, here goes. Turn down the lights, Meredith. Give me a minute to get 
attuned and then ask your questions." 

In the silence of the dim room Elena watched the candlelight flickering over 
Bonnie's lowered eyelashes and Meredith's sober face. She looked down at her own 
hands in her lap, pale against the blackness of the sweater and leggings Meredith had 

lent her. Then she looked at the dancing flame. 

"All right," Bonnie said softly and took the candle. 

Elena's fingers twined together, clenching hard, but she spoke in a low voice so as 

Page 59 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
not to break the atmosphere. "Who is the Other Power in Fell's Church?" 

Bonnie tilted the candle so that the flame licked up its sides. Hot wax streamed 
down like water into the bowl and formed round globules there. 
"I was afraid of that," Bonnie murmured. "That's no answer, nothing. Try a 

different question." 
Disappointed, Elena sat back, fingernails biting into her palms. It was Meredith 
who spoke. 
"Can we find this Other Power if we look? And can we defeat it?" 
"That's two questions," Bonnie said under her breath as she tilted the candle 
again. This time the wax formed a circle, a lumpy white ring. 
"That's unity! The symbol for people joining hands. It means we can do it if we 


stick together." 


Elena's head jerked up. Those were almost the same words she'd said to Stefan 
and Damon. Bonnie's eyes were shining with excitement, and they smiled at each 
other. 
"Watch out! You're still pouring," Meredith said. 
Bonnie quickly righted the candle, looking into the bowl again. The last spill of 
wax had formed a thin, straight line. 


"That's a sword," she said slowly. "It means sacrifice. We can do it if we stick 
together, but not without sacrifice." 
"What kind of sacrifice?" asked Elena. 
"I don't know," Bonnie said, her face troubled. "That's all I can tell you this time." 
She stuck the candle back in the candleholder. 
"Whew," said Meredith, as she got up to turn on the lights. Elena stood, too. 
"Well, at least we know we can beat it," she said, tugging up the leggings, which 
were too long for her. She caught a glimpse of herself in Meredith's mirror. She

certainly didn't look like Elena Gilbert the high school fashion plate anymore. 
Dressed all in black like this, she looked pale and dangerous, like a sheathed sword. 
Her hair fell haphazardly around her shoulders.

certainly didn't look like Elena Gilbert the high school fashion plate anymore. 
Dressed all in black like this, she looked pale and dangerous, like a sheathed sword. 
Her hair fell haphazardly around her shoulders. 

"You could go somewhere else," Bonnie suggested. "I mean, after this is all over, 
you could finish the school year someplace where nobody knows you. Like Stefan 
did." 

"No, I don't think so." Elena was in a strange mood tonight, after spending the 
day alone in the barn watching the snow. "Bonnie," she said abruptly, "would you 
look at my palm again? I want you to tell my future, my personal future." 

"I don't even know if I remember all the stuff my grandmother taught me... but, 
all right, I'll try," Bonnie relented. "There'd just better be no more dark strangers on 
the way, that's all. You've already got all you can handle." She giggled as she took 
Elena's outstretched hand. "Remember when Caroline asked what you could do with 
two? I guess you're finding out now, huh?" 

"Just read my palm, will you?" 

"All right, this is your life line-" Bonnie's stream of patter broke off almost 
before it was started. She stared at Elena's hand, fear and apprehension in her face. 
"It should go all the way down to here," she said. "But it's cut off so short..." 

She and Elena looked at each other without speaking for a moment, while Elena 
felt that same apprehension solidify inside herself. Then Meredith broke in. 

"Well, naturally it's short," she said. "It just means what happened already, when 
Elena drowned." 

"Yes, of course, that must be it," Bonnie murmured. She let go of Elena's hand 
and Elena slowly drew back. "That's it, all right," Bonnie said in a stronger voice. 

Elena was gazing into the mirror again. The girl who gazed back was beautiful, but 
there was a sad wisdom about her eyes that the old Elena Gilbert had never had. She 
realized that Bonnie and Meredith were looking at her. 

"That must be it," she said lightly, but her smile didn't touch her eyes.

"Well, at least I didn't get taken over," Bonnie said. "But I'm sick of this psychic 
stuff anyway; I'm tired of the whole thing. That was the last time, absolutely the last." 

"All right," said Elena, turning away from the mirror, "let's talk about something 
else. Did you find anything out today?" 

"I talked with Alaric, and he's having another get-together next week," Bonnie 

Page 61 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
replied. "He asked Caroline and Vickie and me if we wanted to be hypnotized to 
help us deal with what's been happening. But I'm sure he isn't the Other Power, 
Elena. He's too nice." 

Elena nodded. She'd had second thoughts about her suspicions of Alaric herself. 
Not because he was nice, but because she had spent four days in his attic asleep. 
Would the Other Power really have let her stay there unharmed? Of course, Damon 
had said he'd influenced Alaric to forget that she was up there, but would the Other 
Power have succumbed to Damon's influence? Shouldn't it be far too strong? 

Unless its Powers had temporarily burned out, she thought suddenly. The way 
Stefan's were burning out now. Or unless it had only been pretending to be 
influenced. 

"Well, we won't cross him off the list just yet," she said. "We've got to be careful. 
What about Mrs. Flowers? Did you find out anything about her?" 

"No luck," said Meredith. "We went to the boardinghouse this morning, but she 
didn't answer the door. Stefan said he'd try to track her down in the afternoon." 

"If somebody would only invite me in there, I could watch her, too," Elena said. 
"I feel like I'm the only one not doing anything. I think..." She paused a moment, 
considering, and then said, "I think I'll go by home-by Aunt Judith's, I mean. 
Maybe I'll find Robert hanging around in the bushes or something." 

"We'll go with you," Meredith said. 

"No, it's better for me to do it alone. Really, it is. I can be very inconspicuous 
these days." 

"Then take your own advice and be careful. It's still snowing hard." 

Elena nodded and dropped over the windowsill. 

As she approached her house, she saw that a car was just pulling out of the 
driveway. She melted into the shadows and watched. The headlights illuminated an 
eerie winter sight: the neighbors' black locust tree, like a bare-branched silhouette, 
with a white owl sitting in it. 

As the car roared past, Elena recognized it. Robert's blue Oldsmobile. 

Now, that was interesting. She had an urge to follow him, but a stronger urge to 
check the house, make sure everything was all right. She circled it stealthily, 
examining windows. 


The yellow chintz curtains at the kitchen window were looped back, revealing a 
bright section of kitchen inside. Aunt Judith was closing the dishwasher. Had Robert 
come to dinner? Elena wondered. 

The yellow chintz curtains at the kitchen window were looped back, revealing a 

Page 62

bright section of kitchen inside. Aunt Judith was closing the dishwasher. Had Robert 
come to dinner? Elena wondered. 

Elena wished she could see more than just her aunt's profile in the flickering light 
of the TV. It gave her a strange feeling to look at this room, knowing that she could 
only look and not go in. How long had it been since she realized what a nice room it 
was? The old mahogany whatnot, crowded with china and glassware, the Tiffany 
lamp on the table next to Aunt Judith, the needlepoint pillows on the couch, all 
seemed precious to her now. Standing outside, feeling the feathery caress of the 
snow on the back of her neck, she wished she could go in just for a moment, just for 
a little while. 

Aunt Judith's head was tilting back, her eyes shutting. Elena leaned her forehead 
against the window, then slowly turned away. 

She climbed the quince tree outside her own bedroom, but to her disappointment 
the curtains were shut tight. The maple tree outside Margaret's room was fragile and 
harder to climb, but once she got up she had a good view; these curtains were wide 
open. Margaret was asleep with the bedcovers drawn up to her chin, her mouth 
open, her pale hair spread out like a fan on the pillow. 

Hello, baby, Elena thought and swallowed back tears. It was such a sweetly 
innocent scene: the nightlight, the little girl in bed, the stuffed animals on the shelves 
keeping watch over her. And here came a little white kitten padding through the open 
door to complete the picture, Elena thought. 

Snowball jumped onto Margaret's bed. The kitten yawned, showing a tiny pink 
tongue, and stretched, displaying miniature claws. Then it walked daintily over to 
stand on Margaret's chest. 

Something tingled at the roots of Elena's hair. 

She didn't know if it was some new hunter's sense or sheer intuition, but suddenly 
she was afraid. There was danger in that room. Margaret was in danger. 

The kitten was still standing there, tail swishing back and forth. And all at once 
Elena realized what it looked like. The dogs. It looked the way Chelsea had looked at 
Doug Carson before she lunged at him. Oh, God, the town had quarantined the 
dogs, but nobody had thought about the cats. 

Elena's mind was working at top speed, but it wasn't helping her. It was only 
flashing pictures of what a cat could do with curved claws and needle-sharp teeth. 
And Margaret just lay there breathing softly, oblivious to any danger. 

The fur on Snowball's back was rising, her tail swelling like a bottle brush. Her 


ears flattened and she opened her mouth in a silent hiss. Her eyes were fixed on 
Margaret's face just the way Chelsea's had been on Doug Carson's. 

ears flattened and she opened her mouth in a silent hiss. Her eyes were fixed on 

Page 63 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
Margaret's face just the way Chelsea's had been on Doug Carson's. 

But the snow, settling like a blanket around her, seemed to deaden the words into 
nothingness. A low, discordant wail was started in Snowball's throat as it flicked its 
eyes toward the window and then back to Margaret's face. 

"Margaret, wake up!" Elena shouted. Then, just as the kitten pulled back a curved 
paw, she threw herself at the window. 

She never knew, later, how she managed to hang on. There was no room to kneel 
on the sill, but her fingernails sank into the soft old wood of the casing, and the toe 
of one boot jammed into a foothold below. She banged against the window with her 
body weight, shouting. 

"Get away from her! Wake up, Margaret!" 

Margaret's eyes flew open and she sat up, throwing Snowball backward. The 
kitten's claws caught in the eyelet bedspread as it scrambled to right itself. Elena 
shouted again. 

"Margaret, get off the bed! Open the window, quick!" 

Margaret's four-year-old face was full of sleepy surprise, but no fear. She got up 
and stumbled toward the window while Elena gritted her teeth. 

"That's it. Good girl... now say, 'Come in.' Quick, say it!" 

"Come in," Margaret said obediently, blinking and stepping back. 

The kitten sprang out as Elena fell in. She made a grab for it, but it was too fast. 
Once outside it glided across the maple branches with taunting ease and leaped 
down into the snow, disappearing. 

A small hand was tugging at Elena's sweater. "You came back!" Margaret said, 
hugging Elena's hips. "I missed you." 

"Oh, Margaret, I missed you-" Elena began, and then froze. Aunt Judith's voice 
sounded from the top of the stairs. 

"Margaret, are you awake? What's going on in there?" 

Elena had only an instant to make her decision. "Don't tell her I'm here," she 
whispered, dropping to her knees. "It's a secret; do you understand? Say you let the 
kitty out, but don't tell her I'm here." There wasn't time for any more; Elena dived 
under the bed and prayed. 

From under the dust ruffle, she watched Aunt Judith's stocking feet come into the 
room. She pressed her face into the floorboards, not breathing. 

"Margaret! What are you doing up? Come on, let's get you back in bed," Aunt 
Judith's voice said, and then the bed creaked with Margaret's weight and Elena heard 

Page 64 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 

the noises of Aunt Judith's fussing with the covers. "Your hands are freezing. What 
on earth is the window doing open?" 

the noises of Aunt Judith's fussing with the covers. "Your hands are freezing. What 
on earth is the window doing open?" 

"And now there's snow all over the floor. I can't believe this... Don't you open it 
up again, do you hear me?" A little more bustling and the stocking feet went out 
again. The door shut. 

Elena squirmed out. 

"Good girl," she whispered as Margaret sat up. "I'm proud of you. Now 
tomorrow you tell Aunt Judith that you have to give your kitty away. Tell her it 
scared you. I know you don't want to"-she put up a hand to stop the wail that was 
gathering on Margaret's lips-"but you have to. Because I'm telling you that kitty will 
hurt you if you keep it. You don't want to get hurt, do you?" 

"No," said Margaret, her blue eyes filling. "But-" 

"And you don't want the kitty to hurt Aunt Judith, either, do you? You tell Aunt 
Judith you can't have a kitten or a puppy or even a bird until-well, for a while. 
Don't tell her that I said so; that's still our secret. Tell her you're scared because of 
what happened with the dogs at church." It was better, Elena reasoned grimly, to 
give the little girl nightmares than to have a nightmare play out in this bedroom. 

Margaret's mouth drooped sadly. "Okay." 

"I'm sorry, sweetie." Elena sat down and hugged her. "But that's the way it has to 
be." 

"You're cold," Margaret said. Then she looked up into Elena's face. "Are you an 
angel?" 

"Uh... not exactly." Just the opposite, Elena thought ironically. 

"Aunt Judith said you went to be with Mommy and Daddy. Did you see them 
yet?" 

"I-it's sort of hard to explain, Margaret. I haven't seen them yet, no. And I'm not 
an angel, but I'm going to be like your guardian angel anyway, all right? I'll watch 
over you, even when you can't see me. Okay?" 

"Okay." Margaret played with her fingers. "Does that mean you can't live here 
anymore?" 

Elena looked around the pink-and-white bedroom, at the stuffed animals on the 
shelves and the little writing desk and the rocking horse that had once been hers in 
the corner. "That's what it means," she said softly. 

Page 65

"When they said you went to be with Mommy and Daddy, I said I wanted to go, 
too." 

Elena blinked hard. "Oh, baby. It's not time for you to go, so you can't. And 
Aunt Judith loves you very much, and she'd be lonely without you." 

Margaret nodded, her eyelids drooping. But as Elena eased her down and pulled 


the bedspread over her, Margaret asked one more question. "But don't you love 
me?" 

the bedspread over her, Margaret asked one more question. "But don't you love 
me?" 

Oh, stupid, stupid, Elena thought, forging through the banked snow to the other 
side of Maple Street. She'd missed her chance to ask Margaret whether Robert had 
been at dinner. It was too late now. 

Robert. Her eyes narrowed suddenly. At the church, Robert had been outside and 
then the dogs had gone mad. And tonight Margaret's kitten had gone feral-just a 
little while after Robert's car had pulled out of the driveway. 

Robert has a lot to answer for, she thought. 

But melancholy was pulling at her, tugging her thoughts away. Her mind kept 
returning to the bright house she'd just left, going over the things she'd never see 
again. All her clothes and knickknacks and jewelry-what would Aunt Judith do with 
them? I don't own anything anymore, she thought. I'm a pauper. 

Elena? 

With relief, Elena recognized the mental voice and the distinctive shadow at the 
end of the street. She hurried toward Stefan, who took his hands out of his jacket 
pockets and held hers to warm them. 

"Meredith told me where you'd gone." 

"I went home," Elena said. That was all she could say, but as she leaned against 
him for comfort, she knew that he understood. 

"Let's find someplace we can sit down," he said, and stopped in frustration. All 
the places they used to go were either too dangerous or closed to Elena. The police 
still had Stefan's car. 

Eventually they just went to the high school where they could sit under the 
overhang of a roof and watch the snow sift down. Elena told him what had 
happened in Margaret's room. 

"I'm going to have Meredith and Bonnie spread it around town that cats can

L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
attack, too. People should know that. And I think somebody ought to be watching 
Robert," she concluded. 


"We'll tail him," Stefan said, and she couldn't help smiling. 


"It's funny how much more American you've gotten," she said. "I hadn't thought 
about it in a long time, but when you first came you were a lot more foreign. Now 
nobody would know you hadn't lived here all your life." 


"We adapt quickly. We have to," Stefan said. "There are always new countries, 


. 
new decades, new situations. You'll adapt, too." 


new decades, new situations. You'll adapt, too." 


"You'll learn, in time. If there is anything... good... about what we are, it's time. 
We have plenty of it, as much as we want. Forever." 


" 'Joyous companions forever.' Isn't that what Katherine said to you and 
Damon?" Elena murmured. 


She could feel Stefan's stiffening, his withdrawal. "She was talking about all three 
of us," he said. "I wasn't." 


"Oh, Stefan, please don't, not now. I wasn't even thinking about Damon, only 
about forever. It scares me. Everything about this scares me, and sometimes I think I 
just want to go to sleep and never wake up again..." 


In the shelter of his arms she felt safer, and she found her new senses were just as 
amazing close up as they were at a distance. She could hear each separate pulse of 
Stefan's heart, and the rush of blood through his veins. And she could smell his own 
distinctive scent mingled with the scent of his jacket, and the snow, and the wool of 
his clothes. 


"Please trust me," she whispered. "I know you're angry with Damon, but try to 
give him a chance. I think there's more to him than there seems to be. And I want his 
help in finding the Other Power, and that's all I want from him." 


At that moment it was completely true. Elena wanted nothing to do with the 
hunter's life tonight; the darkness held no appeal for her. She wished she could be at 
home sitting in front of a fire. 


But it was sweet just to be held like this, even if she and Stefan had to sit in the 
snow to do it. Stefan's breath was warm as he kissed the back of her neck, and she 
sensed no further withdrawal in Stefan's body. 


No hunger, either, or at least not the kind she was used to sensing when they were 
close like this. Now that she was a hunter like he, the need was different, a need for 
togetherness rather than for sustenance. It didn't matter. They had lost something, 
but they had gained something, too. She understood Stefan in a way she never had 


Page 67 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
before. And her understanding brought them closer, until their minds were touching, 
almost meshing with each other's. It wasn't the noisy chatter of mental voices; it was 
a deep and wordless communion. As if their spirits were united. 


"I love you," Stefan said against her neck, and she held on tighter. She 
understood now why he'd been afraid to say it for so long. When the thought of 
tomorrow scared you sick, it was hard to make a commitment. Because you didn't 
want to drag someone else down with you. 


Particularly someone you loved. "I love you, too," she made herself say and sat 
back, her peaceful mood broken. "And will you try to give Damon a chance, for my 
sake? Try to work with him?" 


. 
"I'll work with him, but I won't trust him. I can't. I know him too well." 


"I'll work with him, but I won't trust him. I can't. I know him too well." 


"I followed Mrs. Flowers today." Stefan's lip quirked. "All afternoon and evening. 
And you know what she did?" 


"What?" 


"Three loads of wash-in an ancient machine that looked like it was going to 
explode any minute. No clothes dryer, just a wringer. It's all down in the basement. 
Then she went outside and filled about two dozen bird feeders. Then back to the 
basement to wipe off jars of preserves. She spends most of her time down there. 
She talks to herself." 


"Just like a dotty old lady," said Elena. "All right; maybe Meredith's wrong and 
that's all she is." She noticed his change of expression at Meredith's name and 
added, "What?" 


"Well, Meredith may have some explaining to do herself. I didn't ask her about it; 
I thought maybe it was better coming from you. But she went to talk to Alaric 
Saltzman after school today. And she didn't want anyone to know where she was 
going." 


Disquiet uncoiled in Elena's middle. "So what?" 


"So she lied about it afterward-or at least she evaded the issue. I tried to probe 
her mind, but my Powers are just about burnt out. And she's strong-willed." 


"And you had no right! Stefan, listen to me. Meredith would never do anything to 
hurt us or betray us. Whatever she's keeping from us-" 


"So you do admit that she's hiding something." 


"Yes," Elena said reluctantly. "But it's nothing that will hurt us, I'm sure. Meredith 
has been my friend since the first grade..." Without knowing it, Elena let the 
sentence slip away from her. She was thinking of another friend, one who'd been 


Page 68 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
close to her since kindergarten. Caroline. Who last week had tried to destroy Stefan 
and humiliate Elena in front of the entire town. 

And what was it Caroline's diary had said about Meredith? Meredith doesn't do 
anything; she just watches. It's as if she can't act, she can only react to things. 
Besides, I've heard my parents talking about her family-no wonder she never 
mentions them. 

Elena's eyes left the snowy landscape to seek Stefan's waiting face. "It doesn't 
matter," she said quietly. "I know Meredith, and I trust her. I'll trust her to the end." 

"I hope she's worthy of it, Elena," he said. "I really do." 


Ten 

December 12, Thursday morning 

Dear Diary, 

So after a week of work, what have we accomplished? 

Well, between us we've managed to follow our three suspects just about 
continuously for the last six or seven days. Results: reports on Robert's movements 
for the last week, which he spent acting like any normal businessman. Reports on 
Alaric, who hasn't been doing anything unusual for a history teacher. Reports on 
Mrs. Flowers, who apparently spends most of her time in the basement. But we 
haven't really learned anything. 

Stefan says that Alaric met with the principal a couple times, but he couldn't get 
close enough to hear what they were talking about. 

Meredith and Bonnie spread the news about other pets besides dogs being 
dangerous. They didn't need to work very hard at it; it seems as if everybody in 
town is on the verge of hysteria already. Since then there've been several other 
animal attacks reported, but it's hard to know which ones to take seriously. Some 
kids were teasing a squirrel and it bit them. The Massases' pet rabbit scratched 
their littlest boy. Old Mrs. Coomber saw copperhead snakes in her yard, when all 
the snakes should be hibernating. 

The only one I'm sure about is the attack on the vet who was keeping the dogs 
in quarantine. A bunch of them bit him and most of them escaped from the 
holding pens. After that they just disappeared. People are saying good riddance 
and hoping they'll starve in the woods, but I wonder. 

And it's been snowing all the time. Not storming but not stopping, either. I've 
never seen so much snow. 

Stefan's worried about the dance tomorrow night. 

Page 69 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
Which brings us back to: what have we learned so far? What do we know? 
None of our suspects were anywhere near the Massases' or Mrs. Coomber's or the 
vet's when the attacks happened. We're no closer to finding the Other Power than 
we were when we started. 


Marie's little get-together is tonight. Meredith thinks we should go to it. I don't 
know what else there is to do. 


Damon stretched out his long legs and spoke lazily, looking around the barn. "No, 
I don't think it's dangerous, particularly. But I don't see what you expect to 
accomplish." 


"Neither do I, exactly," Elena admitted. "But I don't have any better ideas. Do 
you?" 


. 
"What, you mean about other ways to spend the time? Yes, I do. Do you want 
me to tell you about them?" Elena waved him to silence and he subsided. 


"What, you mean about other ways to spend the time? Yes, I do. Do you want 
me to tell you about them?" Elena waved him to silence and he subsided. 


"In the basement," chorused several voices. 


"And we're all just sitting here. Does anybody have a better idea?" 


Meredith broke the silence. "If you're worried about its being dangerous for me 
and Bonnie, why don't you all come? I don't mean you have to show yourselves. 
You could come and hide in the attic. Then if anything happened, we could scream 
for help and you would hear us." 


"I don't see why anybody's going to be screaming," said Bonnie. "Nothing's 
going to happen there." 


"Well, maybe not, but it doesn't hurt to be safe," Meredith said. "What do you 
think?" 


Elena nodded slowly. "It makes sense." She looked around for objections, but 
Stefan just shrugged, and Damon murmured something that made Bonnie laugh. 


"All right, then, it's decided. Let's go." 


The inevitable snow greeted them as they stepped outside the barn. 


"Bonnie and I can go in my car," Meredith said. "And you three-" 


"Oh, we'll find our own way," Damon said with his wolfish smile. Meredith 
nodded, not impressed. Funny, Elena thought as the other girls walked away; 
Meredith never was impressed with Damon. His charm seemed to have no effect on 
her. 


Page 70 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
She was about to mention that she was hungry when Stefan turned to Damon. 
"Are you willing to stay with Elena the entire time you're over there? Every 
minute?" he said. 
"Try and stop me," Damon said cheerfully. He dropped the smile. "Why?" 
"Because if you are, the two of you can go over alone, and I'll meet you later. I've 
got something to do, but it won't take long." 


Elena felt a wave of warmth. He was trying to trust his brother. She smiled at 
Stefan in approval as he drew her aside. 
"What is it?" 
"I got a note from Caroline today. She asked if I would meet her at the school 
before Alaric's party. She said she wanted to apologize. 
Elena opened her mouth to make a sharp remark, and then shut it again. From 


what she'd heard, Caroline was a sorry sight these days. And maybe it would make 
Stefan feel better to talk to her. 

"Well, you don't have anything to apologize for," she told him. "Everything that 

happened to her was her own fault. You don't think she's dangerous at all?" 

happened to her was her own fault. You don't think she's dangerous at all?" 
"Be careful," Elena said as he started off into the snow. 
The attic was as she remembered it, dark and dusty and full of mysterious 


oilcloth-covered shapes. Damon, who had come in more conventionally through the 
front door, had had to take the shutters off to let her in through the window. After 
that they sat side by side on the old mattress and listened to the voices that came up 
through the ducts. 

"I could think of more romantic settings," Damon murmured, fastidiously pulling 
a cobweb off his sleeve. "Are you sure you wouldn't rather-" 

"Yes," said Elena. "Now hush." 
It was like a game, listening to the bits and pieces of conversations and trying to 
put them together, trying to match each voice to a face. 


"And then I said, I don't care how long you've had the parakeet; get rid of it or 
I'm going to the Snow Dance with Mike Feldman. And he said-" 

Page 71 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
"-rumor going around that Mr. Tanner's grave was dug up last night-" 

"-you hear that everybody but Caroline has dropped out of the snow queen 
competition? Don't you think-" 

"-dead, but I'm telling you I saw her. And no, I wasn't dreaming; she was 
wearing a sort of silvery dress and her hair was all golden and blowing-" 

Elena raised her eyebrows at Damon, then looked meaningfully down at her 
sensible black attire. He grinned. 

"Romanticism," he said. "Myself, I like you in black." 

"Well, you would, wouldn't you?" she murmured. It was strange how much more 
comfortable she felt with Damon these days. She sat quietly, letting the 
conversations drift around her, almost losing track of time. Then she caught a 
familiar voice, cross, and closer than the rest. 

"Okay, okay, I'm going. Okay." 

Elena and Damon exchanged a glance and rose to their feet as the handle on the 
attic door turned. Bonnie peered around the edge. 

"Meredith told me to come up here. I don't know why. She's hogging Alaric and 
it's a rotten party. Achoo!" 

She sat down on the mattress, and after a few minutes Elena sat back down 
beside her. She was beginning to wish that Stefan would get here. By the time the 
door opened again and Meredith came in, she was sure of it. 

"Meredith, what's going on?" 


"Nothing, or at least nothing to worry about. Where's Stefan?" Meredith's cheeks 
were unusually flushed, and there was an odd look about her eyes, as if she were 
holding something tightly under control. 

"Nothing, or at least nothing to worry about. Where's Stefan?" Meredith's cheeks 
were unusually flushed, and there was an odd look about her eyes, as if she were 
holding something tightly under control. 

"Never mind where he is. Who's coming up the stairs?" 

"What do you mean, 'who's coming up the stairs?' " said Bonnie, rising. 

"Everybody just stay calm," Meredith said, taking up a position in front of the 
window as if guarding it. She didn't look overly calm herself, Elena thought. "All 
right," she called, and the door opened and Alaric Saltzman came in. 

Damon's motion was so smooth that even Elena's eyes couldn't follow it; in one 
movement he caught Elena's wrist and pulled her behind him, at the same time 

Page 72 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
moving to face Alaric directly. He ended in a predator's crouch, every muscle drawn 
taut and ready for the attack. 

"Oh, don't," cried Bonnie wildly. She flung herself at Alaric, who had already 
begun to recoil a step from Damon. Alaric nearly lost his balance and groped behind 
himself for the door. His other hand was groping at his belt. 

"Stop it! Stop it!" Meredith said. Elena saw the shape beneath Alaric's jacket and 
realized it was a gun. 

Again, she couldn't quite follow what happened next. Damon let go of her wrist 
and took hold of Alaric's. And then Alaric was sitting on the floor, wearing a dazed 
expression, and Damon was emptying the gun of cartridges, one by one. 

"I told you that was stupid and you wouldn't need it," Meredith said. Elena 
realized she was holding the dark-haired girl by the arms. She must have done it to 
keep Meredith from interfering with Damon, but she didn't remember. 

"These wood-tipped things are nasty; they might hurt somebody," Damon said, 
mildly chiding. He replaced one of the cartridges and snapped the clip back in, 
aiming thoughtfully at Alaric. 

"Stop it," said Meredith intensely. She turned to Elena. "Make him stop, Elena; 
he's only doing more harm. Alaric won't hurt you; I promise. I've spent all week 
convincing him that you won't hurt him." 

"And now I think my wrist is broken," Alaric said, rather calmly. His sandy hair 
was falling into his eyes in front. 

"You've got no one but yourself to blame." Meredith returned bitterly. Bonnie, 
who had been clutching solicitously at Alaric's shoulders, looked up at the familiarity 
of Meredith's tone, and then backed away a few paces and sat down. 

"I can't wait to hear the explanation for this," she said. 

"Please trust me," Meredith said to Elena. 

Elena looked into the dark eyes. She did trust Meredith; she'd said so. And the 
words stirred another memory, her own voice asking for Stefan's trust. She nodded. 


"Damon?" she said. He flipped the gun away casually and then smiled around at 
all of them, making it abundantly clear that he didn't need any such artificial 
weapons. 

"Damon?" she said. He flipped the gun away casually and then smiled around at 
all of them, making it abundantly clear that he didn't need any such artificial 
weapons. 

"Oh, I'm sure," Bonnie said. 

Page 73 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
Elena walked toward Alaric Saltzman. She wasn't afraid of him, but by the way he 
looked only at her, slowly, starting from the feet and then continuing up, he was 
afraid of her. 

She stopped when she was a yard from where he sat on the ground and knelt 
there, looking into his face. 

"Hello," she said. 

He was still holding his wrist. "Hello," he said, and gulped. 

Elena glanced back at Meredith and then looked at Alaric again. Yes, he was 
scared. And with his hair in his eyes that way, he looked young. Maybe four years 
older than Elena, maybe five. No more than that. 

"We're not going to hurt you," she said. 

"That's what I've been telling him," Meredith said quietly. "I explained that 
whatever he's seen before, whatever stories he's heard, you're different. I told him 
what you told me about Stefan, how he's been fighting his nature all those years. I 
told him about what you've been going through, Elena, and how you never asked for 
this." 

But why did you tell him so much? Elena thought. She said to Alaric, "All right, 
you know about us. But all we know about you is that you're not a history teacher." 

"He's a hunter," Damon said softly, menacingly. "A vampire hunter." 

"No," said Alaric. "Or at least, not in the sense that you mean it." He seemed to 
come to some decision. "All right. From what I know of you three-" He broke off, 
looking around the dark room as if suddenly realizing something. "Where's Stefan?" 

"He's coming. In fact, he should be here by now. He was going to stop by the 
school and bring Caroline," Elena said. She was unprepared for Alaric's reaction. 

"Caroline Forbes?" he said sharply, sitting up. His voice sounded the way it had 
when she'd overheard him talking with Dr. Fein' berg and the principal, hard-edged 
and decisive. 

"Yes. She sent him a note today, said she wanted to apologize or something. She 
wanted to meet him at school before the party." 

"He can't go. You've got to stop him." Alaric scrambled to his feet and repeated 
urgently, "You've got to stop him." 

"He's gone already. Why? Why shouldn't he?" Elena demanded. 

"Because I hypnotized Caroline two days ago. I'd tried it earlier with Tyler, with 
no luck. But Caroline's a good subject, and she remembered a little of what 



Page 74 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
happened in the Quonset hut. And she identified Stefan Salvatore as the attacker." 

happened in the Quonset hut. And she identified Stefan Salvatore as the attacker." 

"Don't you understand? You're not just dealing with high school students 
anymore," Alaric said. "It's gone too far. Caroline's father knows about it, and 
Tyler's father. They're concerned for the safety of the town-" 

"Hush! Be quiet!" Elena was casting about with her mind, trying to pick up some 
hint of Stefan's presence. He's let himself get weak, she thought, with the part of her 
that was icy calm amid the whirling fear and panic. At last she sensed something, just 
a trace, but she thought it was Stefan. And it was in distress. 

"Something's wrong," Damon confirmed, and she realized he must have been 
searching, too, with a mind much more powerful than hers. "Let's go." 

"Wait, let's talk first. Don't just go jumping into this." But Alaric might as well 
have been talking to the wind, trying to rein in its destructive power with words. 
Damon was already at the window, and the next moment Elena let herself drop out, 
landing neatly by Damon in the snow. Alaric's voice followed them from above. 

"We're coming, too. Wait for us there. Let me talk to them first. I can take care of 
it..." 

Elena scarcely heard him. Her mind was burning with one purpose, one thought. 
To hurt the people who wanted to hurt Stefan. It's gone too far, all right, she 
thought. And now I'm going to go as far as it takes. If they dare to touch him... 
images flashed through her mind, too quickly to count, of what she would do to 
them. At another time, she might have been shocked at the rush of adrenaline, of 
excitement, that coursed up at the thoughts. 

She could sense Damon's mind beside her as they raced over the snow; it was 
like a blaze of red light and fury. The fierceness inside Elena welcomed it, glad to 
feel it so near. But then something else occurred to her. 

"I'm slowing you down," she said. She was scarcely out of breath, even from 
running through unbroken snow, and they were making extraordinary time. But 
nothing on two legs, or even four, could match the speed of a bird's wings. "Go 
on," she said. "Get there as fast as you can. I'll meet you." 

She didn't stay to watch the blur and shudder of the air, or the swirling darkness 
that ended in the rush of beating wings. But she glanced up at the crow that soared 
up and she heard Damon's mental voice. 

Good hunting, it said, and the winged black shape arrowed toward the school. 

Good hunting, Elena thought after him, meaning it. She redoubled her speed, her 
mind fixed all the while on that glimmer of Stefan's presence. 

Stefan lay on his back, wishing his vision wasn't so blurred or that he had more 
than a tentative hold on consciousness. The blur was partly pain and partly snow,

. 
but there was also a trickle of blood from the three-inch wound in his scalp. 


but there was also a trickle of blood from the three-inch wound in his scalp. 


If only he could collect his thoughts enough to call for help... but the weakness 
that had allowed these men to overcome him so easily prevented that, too. He'd 
scarcely fed since the night he'd attacked Tyler. That was ironic, somehow. His own 
guilt was responsible for the mess he was in. 


I should never have tried to change my nature, he thought. Damon had it right 
after all. 


Everyone's the same-Alaric, Caroline, everyone. Everyone will betray you. I 
should have hunted them all and enjoyed it. 


He hoped Damon would take care of Elena. She'd be safe with him; Damon was 
strong and ruthless. Damon would teach her to survive. He was glad of that. 


But something inside him was crying. 


The crow's sharp eyes spotted the crossing shafts of headlight below and 
dropped. But Damon didn't need the confirmation of sight; he was homing in on the 
faint pulsation that was Stefan's life-force. Faint because Stefan was weak and 
because he'd all but given up. 


You never learn, do you, brother? Damon thought to him. I ought to just leave 
you where you are. But even as he skimmed the ground, he was changing, taking a 
shape that would do more damage than a crow. 


The black wolf leaped into the knot of men surrounding Stefan, aiming precisely 
for the one holding the sharpened cylinder of wood above Stefan's chest. The force 
of the blow knocked the man ten feet backward, and the stake went skittering across 
the grass. Damon restrained his impulse-all the stronger because it fit the instincts 
of the shape he was wearing-to lock his teeth in the man's throat. He twisted 
around and went back for the other men who were still standing. 


His second rush scattered them, but one of them reached the edge of the light and 
turned, lifting something to his shoulder. Rifle, thought Damon. And probably 
loaded with the same specially treated bullets as Alaric's handgun had been. There 
was no way to reach the man before he could get a shot off. The wolf growled and 
crouched for a leap anyway. The man's fleshy face creased in a smile. 


Quick as a striking snake, a white hand reached out of the darkness and knocked 
the rifle away. The man looked around frantically, bewildered, and the wolf let its 
jaws fall open in a grin. Elena had arrived.

L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
Elena watched Mr. Smallwood's rifle bounce across the grass. She enjoyed the 
expression on his face as he spun around, looking for what had grabbed it. And she 
felt the flare of Damon's approval from across the pool of light, fierce and hot like 
the pride of a wolf for its cub's first kill. But when she glimpsed Stefan lying on the 
ground, she forgot everything else. White fury took her breath away, and she started 
toward him. 

"Everybody stop! Just stop everything, right where you are!" 

The shout was borne toward them along with the sound of tires squealing. Alaric 
Saltzman's car nearly spun out as it turned into the staff parking lot and screeched to 
a halt, and Alaric leaped from the car almost before it stopped moving. 

"What's going on here?" he demanded, striding toward the men. 

At the shout, Elena had pulled back automatically into the shadows. Now, she 
looked at the men's faces as they turned toward him. Besides Mr. Smallwood, she 
recognized Mr. Forbes and Mr. Bennett, Vickie Bennett's father. The others must be 
the fathers of the other guys who'd been with Tyler in the Quonset hut, she thought. 

It was one of the strangers who answered the question, in a drawl that couldn't 
quite hide the nervousness underneath. "Well now, we just got a little tired of waiting 
any longer. We decided to speed things up a bit." 

The wolf growled, a low rumbling that rose to a chainsaw snarl. All the men 
flinched back, and Alaric's eyes showed white as he noticed the animal for the first 
time. 

There was another sound, softer and continuous, coming from a figure huddled 
next to one of the cars. Caroline Forbes was whimpering over and over, "They said 
they just wanted to talk to him. They didn't tell me what they were going to do." 

Alaric, with one eye on the wolf, gestured toward her. "And you were going to let 
her see this? A young girl? Do you realize the psychological damage that could do?" 

"What about the psychological damage when her throat gets ripped out?" Mr. 
Forbes returned, and there were shouts of agreement. "That's what we're worried 
about." 

"Then you'd better worry about getting the right man," Alaric said. "Caroline," he 
added, turning toward the girl, "I want you to think, Caroline. We didn't get to finish 
your sessions. I know when we left off you thought you recognized Stefan. But, are 
you absolutely positive it was him? Could it have been somebody else, somebody 
who resembled him?" 

Caroline straightened, bracing herself against the car and raising a tear-stained 
face. She looked at Stefan, who was just sitting up, and then at Alaric. "I..." 

"Think, Caroline. You have to be absolutely certain. Is there someone else it 
could have been, like-" 

Page 77 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 

"Like that guy who calls himself Damon Smith," came Meredith's voice. She was 
standing beside Alaric's car, a slim shadow. "You remember him, Caroline? He came 
to Alaric's first party. He looks like Stefan in some ways." 

"Like that guy who calls himself Damon Smith," came Meredith's voice. She was 
standing beside Alaric's car, a slim shadow. "You remember him, Caroline? He came 
to Alaric's first party. He looks like Stefan in some ways." 

"Yes... it could have been, I suppose. Everything happened so fast... but it could 
have been." 

"And you really can't be sure which it was?" Alaric said. 

"No... not absolutely sure." 

"There," said Alaric. "I told you she needed more sessions, that we couldn't be 
certain of anything yet. She's still very confused." He was walking, carefully, toward 
Stefan. Elena realized that the wolf had withdrawn back into the shadows. She could 
see it, but the men probably couldn't. 

Its disappearance made them more aggressive. "What are you talking about? Who 
is this Smith? I've never seen him." 

"But your daughter Vickie probably has, Mr. Bennett," Alaric said. "That may 
come out in my next session with her. We'll talk about it tomorrow; it can wait that 
long. Right now I think I'd better take Stefan to a hospital." There was discomforted 
shifting among some of the men. 

"Oh, certainly, and while we're waiting anything could happen," began Mr. 
Smallwood. "Any time, anywhere-" 

"So you're just going to take the law into your own hands, then?" Alaric said. His 
voice sharpened. "Whether you've got the right suspect or not. Where's your 
evidence this boy has supernatural powers? What's your proof? How much of a 
fight did he even put up?" 

"There's a wolf around somewhere who put up plenty of fight," Mr. Smallwood 
said, red-faced. "Maybe they're in it together." 

"I don't see any wolf. I saw a dog. Maybe one of the dogs that got out of 
quarantine. But what's that got to do with it? I'm telling you that in my professional 
opinion you've got the wrong man." 

The men were wavering, but there was still some doubt in their faces. Meredith 
spoke up. 

"I think you should know that there've been vampire attacks in this county 
before," she said. "A long time before Stefan came here. My grandfather was a 
victim. Maybe some of you have heard about that." She looked across at Caroline. 

Page 78 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
That was the end of it. Elena could see the men exchanging uneasy glances and 
backing toward their cars. Suddenly they all seemed eager to be somewhere else. 

Mr. Smallwood was one who stayed behind to say, "You said we'd talk about 
this tomorrow, Saltzman. I want to hear what my son says the next time he's 
hypnotized." 


Caroline's father collected her and got in his car fast, muttering something about 
this all being a mistake and nobody taking it too seriously. 

Caroline's father collected her and got in his car fast, muttering something about 
this all being a mistake and nobody taking it too seriously. 

"Are you all right? Did they hurt you?" 

He moved away from Alaric's supporting arm. "Somebody hit me from behind 
while I was talking to Caroline. I'll be all right-now." He shot a glance at Alaric. 
"Thanks. Why?" 

"He's on our side," said Bonnie, joining them. "I told you. Oh, Stefan, are you 
really okay? I thought I was going to faint there for a minute. They weren't serious. I 
mean, they couldn't really have been serious. ..." 

"Serious or not, I don't think we should stay here," said Meredith. "Does Stefan 
really need a hospital?" 

"No," Stefan said, as Elena anxiously examined the cut on his head. "I just need 
rest. Somewhere to sit down." 

"I've got my keys. Let's go to the history room," Alaric said. 

Bonnie was looking around the shadows apprehensively. "The wolf, too?" she 
said, and then jumped as a shadow coalesced and became Damon. 

"What wolf?" he said. Stefan turned slightly, wincing. 

"Thank you, too," he said unemotionally. But Stefan's eyes lingered on his 
brother with something like puzzlement as they walked to the school building. 

In the hallway, Elena pulled him aside. "Stefan, why didn't you notice them 
coming up behind you? Why were you so weak?" 

Stefan shook his head evasively, and she added, "When did you feed last? Stefan, 
when? You always make some excuse when I'm around. What are you trying to do 
to yourself?" 

"I'm all right," he said. "Really, Elena. I'll hunt later." 

"Do you promise?" 

Page 79 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
"I promise." 

It didn't occur to Elena at the moment that they hadn't agreed on what "later" 
meant. She allowed him to lead her on down the hall. 

The history room looked different at night to Elena's eyes. There was a strange 
atmosphere about it, as if the lights were too bright. Just now all the students' desks 
were shoved out of the way, and five chairs were pulled up to Alaric's desk. Alaric, 
who'd just finished arranging the furniture, urged Stefan into his own padded chair. 

"Okay, why don't the rest of you take a seat." 

They just looked at him. After a moment Bonnie sank down into a chair, but Elena 
stood by Stefan, Damon continued to lounge halfway between the group and the 


door, and Meredith pushed some papers to the center of Alaric's desk and perched 
on the corner. 

door, and Meredith pushed some papers to the center of Alaric's desk and perched 
on the corner. 

"Well," said Elena. 

Everyone looked at everyone else. Elena picked up a piece of cotton from the 
first-aid kit she'd grabbed at the door and began dabbing Stefan's head with it. 

"I think it's time for that explanation," she said. 

"Right. Yes. Well, you all seemed to have guessed I'm not a history teacher..." 

"In the first five minutes," Stefan said. His voice was quiet and dangerous, and 
with a jolt Elena realized it reminded her of Damon's. "So what are you?" 

Alaric made an apologetic gesture and said almost diffidently, "A psychologist. 
Not the couch kind," he added hastily as the rest of them exchanged looks. "I'm a 
researcher, an experimental psychologist. From Duke University. You know, where 
the ESP experiments were started." 

"The ones where they make you guess what's on the card without looking at it?" 
Bonnie asked. 

"Yes, well, it's gone a bit beyond that now, of course. Not that I wouldn't love to 
test you with Rhine cards, especially when you're in one of those trances." Alaric's 
face lit with scientific inquiry. Then he cleared his throat and went on. "But-ah-as 
I was saying. It started a couple of years ago when I did a paper on parapsychology. 
I wasn't trying to prove supernatural powers existed, I just wanted to study what 
their psychological effect is on the people who have them. Bonnie, here, is a case in 
point." Alaric's voice took on a lecturer's tone. "What does it do to her, mentally, 
emotionally, to have to deal with these powers?" 

Page 80 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
"It's awful," Bonnie interrupted vehemently. "I don't want them anymore. I hate 
them." 

"Well, there you see," Alaric said. "You'd have made a great case study. My 
problem was that I couldn't find anybody with real psychic powers to examine. 
There were plenty of fakers, all right-crystal healers, dowsers, channelers, you 
name it. But I couldn't find anything genuine until I got a tip from a friend in the 
police department. 

"There was this woman down in South Carolina who claimed she'd been bitten by 
a vampire, and since then she was having psychic nightmares. By that time I was so 
used to fakes I expected her to turn out to be one, too. But she wasn't, at least not 
about being bitten. I never could prove she was really psychic." 

"How could you be sure she'd been bitten?" Elena asked. 

"There was medical evidence. Traces of saliva in her wounds that were similar to 
human saliva-but not quite the same. It contained an anticoagulatory agent similar 
to that found in the saliva of leeches..." Alaric caught himself and hurried on. 


"Anyway, I was sure. And that was how it started. Once I was convinced something 
had really happened to the woman, I started to look up other cases like hers. There 
weren't a lot of them, but they were out there. People who'd encountered vampires. 

"Anyway, I was sure. And that was how it started. Once I was convinced something 
had really happened to the woman, I started to look up other cases like hers. There 
weren't a lot of them, but they were out there. People who'd encountered vampires. 

"But you've never actually seen a vampire," Elena interrupted. "Until now, I mean. 
Is that right?" 

"Well-no. Not in the flesh, as it were. But I've written monographs... and 
things." His voice trailed off. 

Elena bit her lip. "What were you doing with the dogs?" she asked. "At the 
church, when you were waving your hands at them." 

"Oh..." Alaric looked embarrassed. "I've picked up a few things here and there, 
you know. That was a spell an old mountain man showed me for fending off evil. I 
thought it might work." 

"You've got a lot to learn," said Damon. 

"Obviously," Alaric said stiffly. Then he grimaced. "Actually, I figured that out 
right after I got here. Your principal, Brian Newcastle, had heard of me. He knew 
about the studies I do. When Tanner was killed and Dr. Feinberg found no blood in 
the body and lacerations made by teeth in the neck... well, they gave me a call. I 
thought it could be a big break for me-a case with the vampire still in the area. The 
only problem was that once I got here I realized they expected me to take care of the 

Page 81 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
vampire. They didn't know I'd dealt only with the victims before. And... well, maybe 
I was in over my head. But I did my best to justify their confidence-" 

"You faked it," Elena accused. "That was what you were doing when I heard you 
talking to them at your house about finding our supposed lair and all that. You were 
just winging it." 

"Well, not completely," Alaric said. "Theoretically, I am an expert." Then he did a 
double take. "What do you mean, when you heard me talking to them?" 

"While you were out searching for a lair, she was sleeping in your attic," Damon 
informed him dryly. Alaric opened his mouth and then shut it again. 

"What I'd like to know is how Meredith comes into all this," Stefan said. He 
wasn't smiling. 

Meredith, who had been gazing thoughtfully at the jumble of papers on Alaric's 
desk during all this, looked up. She spoke evenly, without emotion. 

"I recognized him, you see. I couldn't remember where I'd seen him at first, 
because it was almost three years ago. Then I realized it was at Granddad's hospital. 
What I told those men was the truth, Stefan. My grandfather was attacked by a 
vampire." 

There was a little silence and then Meredith went on. "It happened a long time 


ago, before I was born. He wasn't badly hurt by it, but he never really got well. He 
became... well, sort of like Vickie, only more violent. It got so that they were afraid 
he'd harm himself, or somebody else. So they took him to a hospital, a place he'd be 
safe."

became... well, sort of like Vickie, only more violent. It got so that they were afraid 
he'd harm himself, or somebody else. So they took him to a hospital, a place he'd be 
safe." 

"I know. I could have... but I couldn't. The family's kept it a secret so long-or 
tried anyway. From what Caroline wrote in her diary, she'd obviously heard. The 
thing is, nobody ever believed Granddad's stories about the vampire. They just 
thought it was another of his delusions, and he had a lot of them. Even I didn't 
believe them... until Stefan came. And then-I don't know, my mind started to put 
little things together. But I didn't really believe what I was thinking until you came 
back, Elena." 

"I'm surprised you didn't hate me," Elena said softly. 

"How could I? I know you, and I know Stefan. I know you're not evil." Meredith 
didn't glance at Damon; he might as well not have been present for all the 
acknowledgment she gave him. "But when I remembered seeing Alaric talking to 
Granddad at the hospital I knew he wasn't, either. I just didn't know exactly how to 

Page 82 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
get all of you together to prove it." 

"I didn't recognize you, either," Alaric said. "The old man had a different name-
he's your mother's father, right? And I may have seen you hanging around the 
waiting room sometime, but you were just a kid with skinny legs then. You've 
changed," he added appreciatively. 

Bonnie coughed, a pointed sound. 

Elena was trying to arrange things in her mind. "So what were those men doing 
out there with a stake if you didn't tell them to be?" 

"I had to ask Caroline's parents for permission to hypnotize her, of course. And I 
reported what I found to them. But if you're thinking I had anything to do with what 
happened tonight, you're wrong. I didn't even know about it." 

"I've told him about what we've been doing, how we've been looking for the 
Other Power," Meredith said. "And he wants to help." 

"I said I might help," Alaric said cautiously. 

"Wrong," said Stefan. "You're either with us or against us. I'm grateful for what 
you did out there, talking to those men, but the fact remains that you started a lot of 
this trouble in the first place. Now you have to decide: are you on our side-or 
theirs?" 

Alaric looked around at each of them, at Meredith's steady gaze and Bonnie's 
raised eyebrows, at Elena kneeling on the floor and at Stefan's already-healing scalp. 
Then he turned to glance at Damon, who was leaning against the wall, dark and 
saturnine. "I'll help," he said at last. "Hell, it's the ultimate case study." 


"All right, then," Elena said. "You're in. Now, what about Mr. Smallwood 
tomorrow? What if he wants you to hypnotize Tyler again?" 

"All right, then," Elena said. "You're in. Now, what about Mr. Smallwood 
tomorrow? What if he wants you to hypnotize Tyler again?" 

"Wait," said Stefan. "There shouldn't be a dance, not if there's any way to prevent 
it. You're on good terms with the principal; you can talk to the school board. Make 
them cancel it." 

Alaric looked startled. "You think something's going to happen?" 

"Yes," Stefan said. "Not just because of what's happened at the other public 
functions, but because something's building up. It's been building up all week; I can 
feel it." 

"So can I," Elena said. She hadn't realized it until that moment, but the tension she 
felt, the sense of urgency, was not just from inside her. It was outside, all around. It 
thickened the air. "Something's going to happen, Alaric. 

Page 83 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
Alaric let out his breath in a soft whistle. "Well, I can try to convince them, but-I 
don't know. Your principal is dead set on keeping everything looking normal. And it 
isn't as if I can give any rational explanation for wanting to shut it down." 

"Try hard," Elena said. 

"I will. And meanwhile, maybe you should think about protecting yourself. If what 
Meredith says is right, then most of the attacks have been on you and people close 
to you. Your boyfriend got dropped in a well; your car got chased into the river; 
your memorial service was broken up. Meredith says even your little sister was 
threatened. If something's going to happen tomorrow, you might want to leave 
town." 

It was Elena's turn to be startled. She had never thought of the attacks in that way, 
but it was true. She heard Stefan's indrawn breath and felt his fingers tighten on hers. 

"He's right," Stefan said. "You should leave, Elena. I can stay here until-" 

"No. I'm not going without you. And," Elena continued, slowly, thinking it out, 
"I'm not going anywhere until we find the Other Power and stop it." She looked up 
at him earnestly, speaking quickly now. "Oh, Stefan, don't you see, nobody else 
even has a chance against it. Mr. Smallwood and his friends don't have a clue. Alaric 
thinks you can fight it by waving your hands at it. None of them know what they're 
up against. We're the only ones who can help." 

She could see the resistance in Stefan's eyes and feel it in the tenor of his 
muscles. But as she kept on looking straight at him, she saw his objections fall one 
by one. For the simple reason that it was the truth, and Stefan hated lying. 

"All right," he said at last, painfully. "But as soon as this is all over, we're leaving. 
I'm not having you stay in a town where vigilantes run around with stakes." 

"Yes." Elena returned the pressure of his fingers with hers. "Once this is all over, 
we'll go." 


Stefan turned to Alaric. "And if there's no way to talk them out of having the 
dance tomorrow, I think we should keep an eye on it. If something does happen, we 
may be able to stop it before it gets out of hand." 

Stefan turned to Alaric. "And if there's no way to talk them out of having the 
dance tomorrow, I think we should keep an eye on it. If something does happen, we 
may be able to stop it before it gets out of hand." 

Elena tilted a doubtful eye toward Bonnie. "Well... it would mean missing the 
dance itself-for those of us who could have gone, I mean." 

Bonnie drew herself up. "Oh, who cares about missing a dance?" she said 
indignantly. "What on earth does a dance matter to anyone?" 

Page 84 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
"Right," said Stefan gravely. "Then it's settled." A spasm of pain seemed to 
overtake him and he winced, looking down. Elena was immediately concerned. 

"You need to get home and rest," she said. "Alaric, can you drive us? It's not that 
far." 

Stefan protested that he was perfectly able to walk, but in the end he gave in. At 
the boardinghouse, after Stefan and Damon had gotten out of the car, Elena leaned in 
Alaric's window for one last question. It had been gnawing at her mind ever since 
Alaric had told them his story. 

"About those people who'd encountered vampires," she said. "Just what were the 
psychological effects? I mean, did they all go crazy or have nightmares? Were any of 
them okay?" 

"It depends on the individual," Alaric said. "And with how many contacts they'd 
had, and what kind of contacts they were. But mostly just with the personality of the 
victim, with how well the individual mind can cope." 

Elena nodded, and said nothing until the lights of Alaric's car had been swallowed 
by the snowy air. Then she turned to Stefan. 

"Matt." 


Twelve 

Stefan looked at Elena, snow crystals dusting his dark hair. "What about Matt?" 

"I remember-something. It's not clear. But that first night, when I wasn't myself 
-did I see Matt then? Did I-?" 

Fear and a sick sense of dismay swelled her throat and cut her words off. But she 
didn't need to finish, and Stefan didn't need to answer. She saw it in his eyes. 

"It was the only way, Elena," he said then. "You would have died without human 
blood. Would you rather have attacked somebody unwilling, hurt them, maybe killed 
them? The need can drive you to that. Is that what you would have wanted?" 

"No," Elena said violently. "But did it have to be Matt? Oh, don't answer that; I 
can't think of anybody else, either." She took a shaky breath. "But now I'm worried 
about him, Stefan. I haven't seen him since that night. Is he okay? What has he said 
to you?" 

"Not much," said Stefan, looking away. " 'Leave me alone' was about the gist of 

it. He also denied that anything happened that night, and said that you were dead." 

"Sounds like one of those individuals who can't cope," Damon commented. 

Page 85 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
"Oh, shut up!" said Elena. "You keep out of this, and while you're at it, you might 
think about poor Vickie Bennett. How d'you think she's coping these days?" 
"It might help if I knew who this Vickie Bennett is. You keep talking about her, 


but I've never met the girl." 
"Yes, you have. Don't play games with me, Damon-the cemetery, remember? 
The ruined church? The girl you left wandering around there in her slip?" 
"Sorry, no. And I usually do remember girls I leave wandering in their slips." 
"I suppose Stefan did it, then," Elena said sarcastically. 
Anger flashed to the surface of Damon's eyes, covered quickly with a disturbing 
smile. 


"Maybe he did. Maybe you did. It's all the same to me, except that I'm getting a 
little tired of accusations. And now-" 
"Wait," said Stefan, with surprising mildness. "Don't go yet. We should talk-" 
"I'm afraid I have a previous engagement." There was a flurry of wings, and 
Stefan and Elena were alone. 
Elena put a knuckle to her lips. "Damn. I didn't mean to make him angry. After he 


was really almost civilized all evening." 


"Never mind," said Stefan. "He likes to be angry. What were you saying about 
Matt?" 
Elena saw the weariness in Stefan's face and put an arm around him. "We won't

talk about it now, but I think tomorrow maybe we should go see him. To tell him..." 
Elena lifted her other hand helplessly. She didn't know what she wanted to tell Matt; 
she only knew that she needed to do something.

Elena lifted her other hand helplessly. She didn't know what she wanted to tell Matt; 
she only knew that she needed to do something. 

Elena looked at him hard. "Are you sure?" 
"Yes." 
"But-will you be all right? I should stay with you-" 


Page 86 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
"I'll be fine, Elena," Stefan said gently, "Go on." 

Elena hesitated, then nodded. "I won't be long," she promised him. 

Unseen, Elena slipped around the side of the frame house with the peeling paint 
and the crooked mailbox labeled Honeycutt. Matt's window was unlocked. Careless 
boy, she thought reprovingly. Don't you know some-thing might come creeping in? 
She eased it open, but of course that was as far as she could go. An invisible barrier 
that felt like a soft wall of thickened air blocked her way. 


"Matt," she whispered. The room was dark, but she could see a vague shape on 
the bed. A digital clock with pale green numbers showed that it was 12:15. "Matt," 
she whispered again. 


The figure stirred. "Uh?" 


"Matt, I don't want to frighten you." She made her voice soothing, trying to wake 
him gently rather than startle him out of his wits. "But it's me, Elena, and I wanted to 
talk. Only you've got to ask me in first. Can you ask me in?" 


"Uh. C'mon in." 


Elena was amazed at the lack of surprise in his voice. It was only after she'd 
gotten over the sill that she realized he was still asleep. 


"Matt. Matt," she whispered, afraid to go too close. The room was stifling and 
overheated, the radiator going full blast. She could see a bare foot sticking out of the 
mound of blankets on the bed and blond hair at the top. 


"Matt?" Tentatively, she leaned over and touched him. 


That got a response. With an explosive grunt, Matt sat bolt upright, whipping 
around. When his eyes met hers, they were wide and staring. 


Elena found herself trying to look small and harmless, nonthreatening. She backed 
away against the wall. "I didn't mean to frighten you. I know it's a shock. But will 
you talk to me?" 


He simply went on staring at her. His yellow hair was sweaty and ruffled up like 
wet chicken feathers. She could see his pulse pounding in his bare neck. She was

afraid he was going to get up and dash out of the room. 
Then his shoulders relaxed, slumping, and he slowly shut his eyes. He was

"Yes," she whispered. 


"You're dead." 


Page 87 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
"No. I'm here." 

"Dead people don't come back. My dad didn't come back." 

"I didn't really die. I just changed." Matt's eyes were still shut in repudiation, and 

Elena felt a cold wave of hopelessness wash over her. "But you wish I had died, 
don't you? I'll leave now," she whispered. 

Matt's face cracked and he started to cry. 

"No. Oh, no. Oh, don't, Matt, please." She found herself cradling him, fighting 
not to cry herself. "Matt, I'm sorry; I shouldn't even have come here." 

"Don't leave," he sobbed. "Don't go away." 

"I won't." Elena lost the fight, and tears fell onto Matt's damp hair. "I didn't mean 
to hurt you, ever," she said. "Not ever, Matt. All those times, all those things I did-
I never wanted to hurt you. Truly..." Then she stopped talking and just held him. 

After a while his breathing quieted and he sat back, swiping his face with a fistful 
of sheet. His eyes avoided hers. There was a look on his face, not just of 
embarrassment, but of distrust, as if he were bracing himself for something he 
dreaded. 

"Okay, so you're here. You're alive," he said roughly. "So what do you want?" 

Elena was dumbfounded. 

"Come on, there must be something. What is it?" 

New tears welled up, but Elena gulped them back. "I guess I deserve that. I know 
I do. But for once, Matt, I want absolutely nothing. I came to apologize, to say that 
I'm sorry for using you-not just that one night, but always. I care about you, and I 
care if you hurt. I thought maybe I could make things better." After a heavy silence, 
she added, "I guess I will leave now." 

"No, wait. Wait a second." Matt scrubbed at his face with the sheet again. 
"Listen. That was stupid, and I'm a jerk-" 

"That was the truth and you're a gentleman. Or you'd've told me to go take a hike 
a long time ago." 

"No, I'm a stupid jerk. I should be banging my head against the wall with joy 
because you're not dead. I will in a minute. Listen." He grabbed her wrist and Elena 
looked at it in mild surprise. "I don't care if you're the Creature from the Black 
Lagoon, It, Godzilla and Frankenstein all rolled up into one. I just-" 

"Matt." Panicked, Elena put her free hand over his mouth. 

Page 88 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 

"I know. You're engaged to the guy in the black cape. Don't worry; I remember 
him. I even like him, though God knows why." Matt took a breath and seemed to 
calm down. "Look, I don't know if Stefan told you. He said a bunch of stuff to me 
-about being evil, about not being sorry for what he did to Tyler. You know what 
I'm talking about?" 

"I know. You're engaged to the guy in the black cape. Don't worry; I remember 
him. I even like him, though God knows why." Matt took a breath and seemed to 
calm down. "Look, I don't know if Stefan told you. He said a bunch of stuff to me 
-about being evil, about not being sorry for what he did to Tyler. You know what 
I'm talking about?" 

Matt nodded. "So it was your basic crap. I should have known." 

"Well, it is and it isn't. The need is strong, stronger than you can imagine." It was 
dawning on Elena that she hadn't fed today and that she'd been hungry before they'd 
set out for Alaric's. "In fact-Matt, I'd better go. Just one thing-if there's a dance 
tomorrow night, don't go. Something's going to happen then, something bad. We're 
going to try to guard it, but I don't know what we can do." 

"Who's 'we'?" Matt said sharply. 

"Stefan and Damon-I think Damon-and me. And Meredith and Bonnie... and 
Alaric Saltzman. Don't ask about Alaric. It's a long story." 

"But what are you guarding against!" 

"I forgot; you don't know. That's a long story, too, but... well, the short answer 
is, whatever killed me. Whatever made those dogs attack people at my memorial 
service. It's something bad, Matt, that's been around Fell's Church for a while now. 
And we're going to try to stop it from doing anything tomorrow night." She tried not 
to squirm. "Look, I'm sorry, but I really should leave." Her eyes drifted, despite 
herself, to the broad blue vein in his neck. 

When she managed to tear her gaze away and look at his face, she saw shock 
giving way to sudden understanding. Then to something incredible: acceptance. "It's 
okay," Matt said. 

She wasn't sure she'd heard correctly. "Matt?" 

"I said, it's okay. It didn't hurt me before." 

"No. No, Matt, really. I didn't come here for that-" 

"I know. That's why I want to. I want to give you something you didn't ask for." 
After a moment he said, "For old friends' sake." 

Stefan, Elena was thinking. But Stefan had told her to come, and come alone. 
Stefan had known, she realized. And it was all right. It was his gift to Matt-and to 
her.

But I'm coming back to you, Stefan, she thought. 


As she leaned toward him, Matt said, "I'm going to come and help you tomorrow, 
you know. Even if I'm not invited." 


Then her lips touched his throat. 


December 13, Friday 


. 
Dear Diary, 


Dear Diary, 


I know I've written that before, or thought it at least. But tonight is the night, 
the big one, when everything is going to happen. This is it. 


Stefan feels it, too. He came back from school today to tell me that the dance is 
still on-Mr. Newcastle didn't want to cause a panic by canceling it or something. 
What they're going to do is have "security" outside, which means the police, I 
guess. And maybe Mr. Smallwood and some of his friends with rifles. Whatever's 
going to happen, I don't think they can stop it. 


I don't know if we can, either. 


It's been snowing all day. The pass is blocked, which means nothing gets in or 
out of town on wheels. Until the snowplow gets up there, which won't be until 
morning, which will be too late. 


And the air has a funny feeling to it. Not just snow. It's as if something even 
colder than that is waiting. It's pulled back the way the ocean pulls back before a 
tidal wave. When it lets go... 


I thought about my other diary today, the one under the floorboards of my 
bedroom closet. If I own anything anymore, I own that diary. I thought about 
getting it out, but I don't want to go home again. I don't think I could cope, and I 
know Aunt Judith couldn't if she saw me. 


I'm surprised anybody's been able to cope. Meredith, Bonnie-especially 
Bonnie. Well, Meredith, too, considering what her family has been through. Matt. 


They're good and loyal friends. It's funny, I used to think that without a whole 
galaxy of friends and admirers I wouldn't survive. Now I'm perfectly happy with 
three, thank you. Because they're real friends. 


I didn't know how much I cared about them before. Or about Margaret, or 
Aunt Judith even. And everybody at school... I know a few weeks ago I was saying 
that I didn't care if the entire population of Robert E. Lee dropped dead, but that 
isn't true. Tonight I'm going to do my best to protect them. 


Page 90 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
I know I'm jumping from subject to subject, but I'm just talking about things 
that are important to me. Kind of gathering them together in my mind. Just in 
case. 

Well, it's time. Stefan is waiting. I'm going to finish this last line and then go. 

I think we're going to win. I hope so. 

We're going to try. 

The history room was warm and brightly lit. On the other side of the school 
building, the cafeteria was even brighter, shining with Christmas lights and 
decorations. Upon arriving, Elena had scrutinized it from a cautious distance, 


watching the couples arrive for the dance and pass by the sheriff's officers at the 
door. Feeling Damon's silent presence behind her, she had pointed out a girl with 
long, light brown hair. 

watching the couples arrive for the dance and pass by the sheriff's officers at the 
door. Feeling Damon's silent presence behind her, she had pointed out a girl with 
long, light brown hair. 

"I'll take your word for it," he replied. 

Now, she looked around their makeshift headquarters for the night. Alaric's desk 
had been cleared, and he was bent over a rough map of the school. Meredith leaned 
in beside him, her dark hair sweeping his sleeve. Matt and Bonnie were out mingling 
with the dancegoers in the parking lot, and Stefan and Damon were prowling the 
perimeter of the school grounds. They were going to take turns. 

"You'd better stay inside," Alaric had told Elena. "All we need is for somebody to 
see you and start chasing you with a stake." 

"I've been walking around town all week," Elena said, amused. "If I don't want to 
be seen, you don't see me." But she agreed to stay in the history room and 
coordinate. 

It's like a castle, she thought as she watched Alaric plot out the positions of 
sheriff's officers and other men on the map. And we're defending it. Me and my 
loyal knights. 

The round, flat-faced clock on the wall ticked the minutes by. Elena watched it as 
she let people in the door and let them out again. She poured hot coffee out of a 
Thermos for those who wanted it. She listened to the reports come in. 

"Everything's quiet on the north side of the school." 

"Caroline just got crowned snow queen. Big surprise." 

"Some rowdy kids in the parking lot-the sheriff just rounded them up..." 

Page 91 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
Midnight came and went. 

"Maybe we were wrong," Stefan said an hour or so later. It was the first time 

they'd all been inside together since the beginning of the evening. 

"Maybe it's happening somewhere else," said Bonnie, emptying out a boot and 
peering into it. 

"There's no way to know where it's going to happen," Elena said firmly. "But we 
weren't wrong about it happening." 

"Maybe," said Alaric thoughtfully, "there is a way. To find out where it's going to 

happen, I mean." As heads raised questioningly, he said, "We need a precognition." 

All eyes turned to Bonnie. 

"Oh, no," Bonnie said. "I'm through with all that. I hate it." 

"It's a great gift-" began Alaric. 

"It's a great big pain. Look, you don't understand. The ordinary predictions are 

bad enough. It seems like most of the time I'm finding out things I don't want to 


know. But getting taken over-that's awful. And afterward I don't even remember 
what I've said. It's horrible." 

know. But getting taken over-that's awful. And afterward I don't even remember 
what I've said. It's horrible." 

Bonnie sighed. "It's what happened to me in the church," she said patiently. "I 
can do other kinds of predictions, like divining with water or reading palms"-she 
glanced at Elena, and then away-"and stuff like that. But then there are times when 
-someone-takes me over and just uses me to talk for them. It's like having 
somebody else in my body." 

"Like in the graveyard, when you said there was something there waiting for me," 
said Elena. "Or when you warned me not to go near the bridge. Or when you came 
to dinner and said that Death, my death, was in the house." She looked automatically 
around at Damon, who returned her gaze impassively. Still, that had been wrong, she 
thought. Damon hadn't been her death. So what had the prophecy meant? For just an 
instant something glimmered in her mind, but before she could get a grasp on it, 
Meredith interrupted. 

"It's like another voice that speaks through Bonnie," Meredith explained to Alaric. 
"She even looks different. Maybe you weren't close enough in the church to see." 

Page 92 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
"But why didn't you tell me about this?" Alaric was excited. "This could be 
important. This-entity-whatever it is-could give us vital information. It could 
clear up the mystery of the Other Power, or at least give us a clue how to fight it." 

Bonnie was shaking her head. "No. It isn't something I can just whistle up, and it 
doesn't answer questions. It just happens to me. And I hate it." 

"You mean you can't think of anything that tends to set it off? Anything that's led 
to it happening before?" 

Elena and Meredith, who knew very well what could set it off, looked at each 
other. Elena bit the inside of her cheek. It was Bonnie's choice. It had to be Bonnie's 
choice. 

Bonnie, who was holding her head in her hands, shot a sideways glance through 
red curls at Elena. Then she shut her eyes and moaned. 

"Candles," she said. 

"What?" 

"Candles. A candle flame might do it. I can't be sure, you understand; I'm not 
promising anything-" 

"Somebody go ransack the science lab," said Alaric. 

It was a scene reminiscent of the day Alaric had come to school, when he'd asked 
them all to put their chairs in a circle. Elena looked at the circle of faces lit eerily 
from below by the candle's flame. There was Matt, with his jaw set. Beside him, 
Meredith, her dark lashes throwing shadows upward. And Alaric, leaning forward in 
his eagerness. Then Damon, light and shadow dancing over the planes of his face. 


And Stefan, high cheekbones looking too sharply defined to Elena's eyes. And 
finally, Bonnie, looking fragile and pale even in the golden light of the candle. 

And Stefan, high cheekbones looking too sharply defined to Elena's eyes. And 
finally, Bonnie, looking fragile and pale even in the golden light of the candle. 

"I'm just going to look into the candle," Bonnie said, her voice quivering slightly. 
"And not think of anything. I'm going to try to-leave myself open to it." She began 
to breathe deeply, gazing into the candle flame. 

And then it happened, just as it had before. Bonnie's face smoothed out, all 
expression draining away. Her eyes went blank as the stone cherub's in the 
graveyard. 

She didn't say a word. 

That was when Elena realized they hadn't agreed on what to ask. She groped 
through her mind to find a question before Bonnie lost contact. "Where can we find 

Page 93 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
the Other Power?" she said, just as Alaric blurted out, "Who are you?" Their voices 
mingled, their questions intertwining. 

Bonnie's blank face turned, sweeping the circle with sightless eyes. Then the voice 
that wasn't Bonnie's voice said, "Come and see." 

"Wait a minute," Matt said, as Bonnie stood up, still entranced, and made for the 
door. "Where's she going?" 

Meredith grabbed for her coat. "Are we going with her?" 

"Don't touch her!" said Alaric, jumping up as Bonnie went out the door. 

Elena looked at Stefan, and then at Damon. With one accord, they followed, 
trailing Bonnie down the empty, echoing hall. 

"Where are we going? Which question is she answering?" Matt demanded. Elena 
could only shake her head. Alaric was jogging to keep up with Bonnie's gliding pace. 

She slowed down as they emerged into the snow, and to Elena's surprise, walked 
up to Alaric's car in the staff parking lot and stood beside it. 

"We can't all fit; I'll follow with Matt," Meredith said swiftly. Elena, her skin 
chilled with apprehension as well as cold air, got in the back of Alaric's car when he 
opened it for her, with Damon and Stefan on either side. Bonnie sat up front. She 
was looking straight ahead, and she didn't speak. But as Alaric pulled out of the 
parking lot, she lifted one white hand and pointed. Right on Lee Street and then left 
on Arbor Green. Straight out toward Elena's house and then right on Thunderbird. 
Heading toward Old Creek Road. 

It was then that Elena realized where they were going. 

They took the other bridge to the cemetery, the one everyone always called "the 
new bridge" to distinguish it from Wickery Bridge, which was now gone. They were 
approaching from the gate side, the side Tyler had driven up when he took Elena to 
the ruined church. 


Alaric's car stopped just where Tyler's had stopped. Meredith pulled up behind 
them. 

Alaric's car stopped just where Tyler's had stopped. Meredith pulled up behind 
them. 

"Where are you taking us?" she said. "Listen to me. Will you just tell us which 
question you're answering?" 

"Come and see." 

Helplessly, Elena looked at the others. Then she stepped over the threshold. 
Bonnie walked slowly to the white marble tomb, and stopped. 

Page 94 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
Elena looked at it, and then at Bonnie's ghostly face. Every hair on her arms and 
the back of her neck was standing up. "Oh, no..." she whispered. "Not that." 

"Elena, what are you talking about?" Meredith said. 

Dizzy, Elena looked down at the marble countenances of Thomas and Honoria 
Fell, lying on the stone lid of their tomb. "This thing opens," she whispered. 


Thirteen 

"You think we're supposed to-look inside?" Matt said. 

"I don't know," Elena said miserably. She didn't want to see what was inside that 
tomb now any more than she had when Tyler had suggested opening it to vandalize 
it. "Maybe we won't be able to get it open," she added. "Tyler and Dick couldn't. It 
started to slide only when I leaned on it." 

"Lean on it now; maybe there's some sort of hidden spring mechanism," Alaric 
suggested, and when Elena did, with no results, he said, "All right, let's all get a grip, 
and brace ourselves-like this. Come on, now-" 

From his crouch, he looked up at Damon, who was standing motionless next to 
the tomb, looking faintly amused. "Excuse me," Damon said, and Alaric stepped 
back, frowning. Damon and Stefan each gripped an end of the stone lid and lifted. 

The lid came away, making a grinding sound as Damon and Stefan slid it to the 
ground on one side of the tomb. 

Elena couldn't bring herself to move closer. 

Instead, fighting nausea, she concentrated on Stefan's expression. It would tell her 
what was to be found in there. Pictures crashed through her mind, of 
parchment-colored mummified bodies, of rotting corpses, of grinning skulls. If 
Stefan looked horrified or sickened, disgusted... 

But as Stefan looked into the open tomb, his face registered only disconcerted 
surprise. 

Elena couldn't stand it any longer. "What is it?" 

He gave her a crooked smile and said with a glance at Bonnie, "Come and see." 

Elena inched up to the tomb and looked down. Then her head flew up, and she 
regarded Stefan in astonishment. 

"What is it?" 

"I don't know," he replied. He turned to Meredith and Alaric. "Does either of you 

Page 95 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
have a flashlight? Or some rope?" 

After a look inside the stone box, they both headed for their cars. Elena remained 
where she was, staring down, straining her night vision. She still couldn't believe it. 

The tomb was not a tomb, but a doorway. 

Now she understood why she had felt a cold wind blow from it when it had 
shifted beneath her hand that night. She was looking down into a kind of vault or 
cellar in the ground. She could see only one wall, the one that dropped straight down 
below her, and that one had iron rungs driven into the stone, like a ladder. 

"Here you go," Meredith said to Stefan, returning. "Alaric's got a flashlight, and 
here's mine. And here's the rope Elena put in my car when we went looking for you." 


The narrow beam of Meredith's flashlight swept the dark room below. "I can't see 
very far inside, but it looks empty," Stefan said. "I'll go down first." 

The narrow beam of Meredith's flashlight swept the dark room below. "I can't see 
very far inside, but it looks empty," Stefan said. "I'll go down first." 

Bonnie hadn't moved. She was still standing there with that utterly abstracted 
expression on her face, as if she saw nothing around her. Without a word, she 
swung a leg over the edge of the tomb, twisted, and began to descend. 

"Whoa," said Stefan. He tucked the flashlight in his jacket pocket, put a hand on 
the tomb's foot, and jumped. 

Elena had no time to enjoy Alaric's expression; she leaned down and shouted, 
"Are you okay?" 

"Fine." The flashlight winked at her from below. "Bonnie will be all right, too. The 
rungs go all the way down. Better bring the rope anyway." 

Elena looked at Matt, who was closest. His blue eyes met hers with helplessness 
and a certain resignation, and he nodded. She took a deep breath and put a hand on 
the foot of the tomb as Stefan had. Another hand suddenly clamped on her wrist. 

"I've just thought of something," Meredith said grimly. "What if Bonnie's entity is 
the Other Power?" 

"I thought of that a long time ago," Elena said. She patted Meredith's hand, pried 
it off, and jumped. 

She stood up into Stefan's supporting arm and looked around. "My God..." 

It was a strange place. The walls were faced with stone. They were smooth and 
almost polished-looking. Driven into them at intervals were iron candelabra, some of 
which had the remains of wax candles in them. Elena could not see the other end of 
the room, but the flashlight showed a wrought-iron gate quite close, like the gate in 

Page 96 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
some churches used to screen off an altar. 

Bonnie was just reaching the bottom of the rung ladder. She waited silently while 
the others descended, first Matt, then Meredith, then Alaric with the other flashlight. 

Elena looked up. "Damon?" 

She could see his silhouette against the lighter black rectangle that was the tomb's 
opening to the sky. "Well?" 

"Are you with us?" she asked. Not "Are you coming with us?" She knew he 
would understand the difference. 

She waited five heartbeats in the silence that followed. Six, seven, eight... 

There was a rush of air, and Damon landed neatly. But he didn't look at Elena. His 
eyes were oddly distant, and she could read nothing in his face. 

"It's a crypt," Alaric was saying in wonder, as his flashlight scythed through the 
darkness. "An underground chamber beneath a church, used as a burial place. 
They're usually built under larger churches." 


Bonnie walked straight up to the scrolled gate and placed one small white hand on 
it, opening it. It swung away from her. 

Bonnie walked straight up to the scrolled gate and placed one small white hand on 
it, opening it. It swung away from her. 

Bonnie stopped. 

This is it, thought Elena, her breath catching in her throat. Oh, my God, this is it; 
this is really it. She had the sudden intense sensation of being in the middle of a lucid 
dream, one where she knew she was dreaming but couldn't change anything or wake 
up. Her muscles deadlocked. 

She could smell fear from the others, and she could feel the sharp edge of it from 
Stefan beside her. His flashlight skimmed over objects beyond Bonnie, but at first 
Elena's eyes could make no sense of them. She saw angles, planes, contours, and 
then something leaped into focus. A dead-white face, hanging grotesquely sideways 
... 

The scream never got out of her throat. It was only a statue, and the features were 
familiar. They were the same as on the lid of the tomb above. This tomb was the 
twin of the one they had come through. Except that this one had been ravaged, the 
stone lid broken in two and flung against the wall of the crypt. Something was 
scattered about the floor like fragile ivory sticks. Bits of marble, Elena told her brain 
desperately; it's only marble, bits of marble. 

They were human bones, splintered and crushed. 

Page 97 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
Bonnie turned around. 

Her heart-shaped face swung as if those fixed blank eyes were surveying the 
group. She ended directly facing Elena. 

Then, with a shudder, she stumbled and pitched violently forward like a 
marionette whose strings have been cut. 

Elena barely caught her, half falling herself. "Bonnie? Bonnie?" The brown eyes 
that looked up at her, dilated and disoriented, were Bonnie's own frightened eyes. 
"But what happened?" Elena demanded. "Where did it go?" 

"I am here." 

Above the plundered tomb, a hazy light was showing. No, not a light, Elena 
thought. She was sensing it with her eyes, but it was not light in the normal spectrum. 
This was something stranger than infrared or ultraviolet, something human senses 
had not been built to see. It was being revealed to her, forced on her brain, by some 
outside Power. 

"The Other Power," she whispered, her blood freezing. 

"No, Elena." 


The voice was not sound, in the same way that the vision was not light. It was 
quiet as star shine, and sad. It reminded her of something. 

The voice was not sound, in the same way that the vision was not light. It was 
quiet as star shine, and sad. It reminded her of something. 

"I've been waiting for you," Honoria Fell's voice said softly. "Here I can speak to 
you at last in my own form, and not through Bonnie's lips. Listen to me. Your time is 
short, and the danger is very great." 

Elena found her tongue. "But what is this room? Why did you bring us here?" 

"You asked me to. I couldn't show you until you asked. This is your 
battleground." 

"I don't understand." 

"This crypt was built for me by the people of Fell's Church. A resting place for 
my body. A secret place for one who had secret powers in life. Like Bonnie, I knew 
things no one else could know. I saw things no one else could see." 

"You were psychic," Bonnie whispered huskily. 

"In those days, they called it witchery. But I never used my powers for harm, and 
when I died they built me this monument so that my husband and I could lie in 
peace. But then, after many years, our peace was disturbed." 

Page 98 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
The eldritch light ebbed and flowed, Honoria's form wavering. "Another Power 
came to Fell's Church, full of hatred and destruction. It defiled my resting place and 
scattered my bones. It made its home here. It went out to work evil against my town. 
I woke. 

"I have tried to warn you against it from the beginning, Elena. It lives here below 
the graveyard. It has been waiting for you, watching you. Sometimes in the form of 
an owl-" 

An owl. Elena's mind raced ahead. An owl, like the owl she had seen nesting in 
the belfry of the church. Like the owl that had been in the barn, like the owl in the 
black locust tree by her house. 

White owl... hunting bird... flesh eater... she thought. And then she remembered 
great white wings that seemed to stretch to the horizon on either side. A great bird 
made of mist or snow, coming after her, focused on her, full of bloodlust and animal 
hate... 

"No!" she cried, memory engulfing her. 

She felt Stefan's hands on her shoulders, his fingers digging in almost painfully. It 
brought her back to reality. Honoria Fell was still speaking. 

"And you, Stefan, it has been watching you. It hated you before it hated Elena. It 
has been tormenting you and playing with you like a cat with a mouse. It hates those 
you love. It is full of poisoned love itself." 


Elena looked involuntarily behind her. She saw Meredith, Alaric, and Matt 
standing frozen. Bonnie and Stefan were next to her. But Damon... where was 
Damon? 

Elena looked involuntarily behind her. She saw Meredith, Alaric, and Matt 
standing frozen. Bonnie and Stefan were next to her. But Damon... where was 
Damon? 

"The Snow Dance!" Meredith said sharply. 

"Yes. And this time they will kill until the last of them is killed." 

"We have to warn those people," Matt said. "Everyone at that dance-" 

"You will never be safe until the mind that controls them is destroyed. The killing 

will go on. You must destroy the Power that hates; that is why I have brought you 
here." 

There was another flux in the light; it seemed to be receding. "You have the 
courage, if you can find it. Be strong. This is the only help I can give you." 

Page 99 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
"Wait-please-" Elena began. 
The voice continued relentlessly, taking no heed of her. "Bonnie, you have a 


choice. Your secret powers are a responsibility. They are also a gift, and one that 
can be taken away. Do you choose to relinquish them?" 
"I-" Bonnie shook her head, frightened. "I don't know. I need time..." 
"There is no time. Choose." The light was dwindling, caving in on itself. 
Bonnie's eyes were bewildered and uncertain as she searched Elena's face for 
help. "It's your choice," Elena whispered. "You have to decide for yourself." 
Slowly, the uncertainty left Bonnie's face, and she nodded. She stood away from 


Elena, without support, turning back to the light. "I'll keep them," she said huskily. 
"I'll deal with them somehow. My grandmother did." 
There was a flicker of something like amusement from the light. "You've chosen 
wisely. May you use them as well. This is the last time I will speak to you." 
"But-" 
"I have earned my rest. The fight is yours." And the glow faded, like the last 


embers of a dying fire. 
With it gone, Elena could feel the pressure all around her. Something was going to 
happen. Some crushing force was coming toward them, or hanging over them. 
"Stefan-" 


Stefan felt it too; she could tell. "Come on," Bonnie said, her voice panicked. 


"We have to get out of here." 
"We have to get to the dance," Matt gasped. His face was white. "We have to 
help them-" 


"Fire," cried Bonnie, looking startled, as if the thought had just come to her. "Fire 


. 
won't kill them, but it will hold them off-" 
won't kill them, but it will hold them off-" 
"Alaric." Stefan spoke with the ring of command. "You go back. Take the others; 


do what you can. I'll stay-" 
"I think we all should leave!" Alaric shouted. He had to shout to be heard over the 
deafening noise surrounding them.

L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
His weaving flashlight showed Elena something she hadn't noticed before. In the 
wall next to her was a gaping hole, as if the stone facing had been ripped away. And 
beyond was a tunnel into the raw earth, black and endless. 

Where does it go? Elena wondered, but the thought was lost among the tumult of 
her fear. White owl... hunting bird... flesh eater... crow, she thought, and suddenly 
she knew with blinding clarity what she was afraid of. 

"Where's Damon?" she screamed, dragging Stefan around as she turned, looking. 
"Where's Damon?" 

"Get out!" cried Bonnie, her voice shrill with terror. She threw herself toward the 
gate just as the sound split the darkness. 

It was a snarl, but not a dog's snarl. It could never be mistaken for that. It was so 
much deeper, heavier, more resonant. It was a huge sound, and it reeked of the 
jungle, of the hunting bloodlust. It reverberated in Elena's chest, jarred her bones. 

It paralyzed her. 

The sound came again, hungry and savage, but somehow almost lazy. That 
confident. And with it came heavy footfalls from the tunnel. 

Bonnie was trying to scream, making only a thin whistling sound. In the blackness 
of the tunnel, something was coming. A shape that moved with a rangy feline swing. 
Elena recognized the snarl now. It was the sound of the largest of the hunting cats, 
larger than a lion. The tiger's eyes showed yellow as it reached the end of the tunnel. 

And then everything happened at once. 

Elena felt Stefan try to pull her backward to get her out of the way. But her own 
petrified muscles were a hindrance to him, and she knew that it was too late. 

The tiger's leap was grace itself, powerful muscles launching it into the air. In that 
instant, she saw it as if caught in the light of a flashbulb, and her mind noted the lean 
shining flanks and the supple backbone. But her voice screamed out on its own. 

"Damon, no!" 

It was only as the black wolf sprang out of the darkness to meet it that she 
realized the tiger was white. 

The great cat's rush was thrown off by the wolf, and Elena felt Stefan wrench her 
out of the way, pulling her sideways to safety. Her muscles had melted like 


snowflakes, and she yielded numbly as he put her against the wall. The lid of the 
tomb was between her and the snarling white shape now, but the gate was on the 
other side of the fight. 

snowflakes, and she yielded numbly as he put her against the wall. The lid of the 

01 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
tomb was between her and the snarling white shape now, but the gate was on the 
other side of the fight. 

It was an impossible match. The black wolf, vicious and aggressive though it 
might be, didn't stand a chance. One swipe of the tiger's huge claws laid the wolf's 
shoulder open to the bone. Its jaws snarled open as it tried to get a bone-cracking 
grip on the wolf's neck. 

But then Stefan was there, training the blaze of the flashlight into the cat's eyes, 
thrusting the wounded wolf out of the way. Elena wished she could scream, wished 
she could do something to release this rushing ache inside her. She didn't 
understand; she didn't understand anything. Stefan was in danger. But she couldn't 
move. 

"Get out!" Stefan was shouting to the others. "Do it now; get out!" 

Faster than any human, he darted out of the way of a white paw, keeping the light 
in the tiger's eyes. Meredith was on the other side of the gate now. Matt was half 
carrying and half dragging Bonnie. Alaric was through. 

The tiger lunged and the gate crashed shut. Stefan fell to the side, slipping as he 
tried to scramble up again. 

"We won't leave you-" Alaric cried. 

"Go!" shouted Stefan. "Get to the dance; do what you can! Go!" 

The wolf was attacking again, despite the bleeding wounds in its head, and its 
shoulder where muscle and tendon lay exposed and shining. The tiger fought back. 
The animal sounds rose to a volume that Elena couldn't stand. Meredith and the 
others were gone; Alaric's flashlight had disappeared. 

"Stefan!" she screamed, seeing him poised to jump into the fight again. 

If he died, she would die, too. And if she had to die, she wanted it to be with him. 

The paralysis left her, and she stumbled toward him, sobbing, reaching out to 
clutch him tightly. She felt his arm around her as he held her with his body between 
her and the noise and violence. But she was stubborn, as stubborn as he was. She 
twisted, and then they faced it together. 

The wolf was down. It was lying on its back, and although its fur was too dark to 
show the blood, a red pool gathered beneath it. The white cat stood above it, jaws 
gaping inches from the vulnerable black throat. 


But the death-dealing bite to the neck didn't come. Instead the tiger raised its head 
to look at Stefan and Elena.

The whiskers were straight and slender, like silver wires. Its fur was pure white, 
striped with faint marks like unburnished gold. White and gold, she thought, 
remembering the owl in the barn. And that stirred another memory... of something 
she'd seen... or something she'd heard about... 

With a heavy swipe, the cat sent the flashlight flying out of Stefan's hand. Elena 
heard him hiss in pain, but she could no longer see anything in the blackness. Where 
there was no light at all, even a hunter was blind. Clinging to him, she waited for the 
pain of the killing blow. 

But suddenly her head was reeling; it was full of gray and spinning fog and she 
couldn't hold on to Stefan. She couldn't think; she couldn't speak. The floor seemed 
to be dropping away from her. Dimly, she realized that Power was being used 
against her, that it was overwhelming her mind. 

She felt Stefan's body giving, slumping, falling away from her, and she could no 
longer resist the fog. She fell forever and never knew when she hit the ground.

White owl... hunting bird... hunter... tiger. Playing with you like a cat with a 
mouse. Like a cat... a great cat... a kitten. A white kitten. 

Death is in the house. 

And the kitten, the kitten had run from Damon. Not out of fear, but out of the fear 
of being discovered. Like when it had stood on Margaret's chest and wailed at the 
sight of Elena outside the window. 

Elena moaned and almost surfaced from unconsciousness, but the gray fog 
dragged her back under before she could open her eyes. Her thoughts seethed 
around her again. 

Poisoned love... Stefan, it hated you before it hated Elena... White and gold... 
something white... something white under the tree... 

This time, when she struggled to open her eyes, she succeeded. And even before 
she could focus in the dim and shifting light, she knew. She finally knew. 

The figure in the trailing white dress turned from the candle she was lighting, and 
Elena saw what might have been her own face on its shoulders. But it was a subtly 
distorted face, pale and beautiful as an ice sculpture, but wrong. It was like the 
endless reflections of herself Elena had seen in her dream of the hall of mirrors. 
Twisted and hungry, and mocking. 

"Hello, Katherine," she whispered. 

Katherine smiled, a sly and predatory smile. "You're not as stupid as I thought," 

03 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
she said. 


Her voice was light and sweet-silvery, Elena thought. Like her eyelashes. There 
were silvery lights in her dress when she moved, too. But her hair was gold, almost 
as pale a gold as Elena's own. Her eyes were like the kitten's eyes: round and jewel 
blue. At her throat she wore a necklace with a stone of the same vivid color. 


Elena's own throat was sore, as if she had been screaming. It felt dry as well. 
When she turned her head slowly to the side, even that little motion hurt. 


Stefan was beside her, slumped forward, bound by his arms to the wrought-iron 
pickets of the gate. His head sagged against his chest, but what she could see of his 
face was deathly white. His throat was torn, and blood had dripped onto his collar 
and dried. 


Elena turned back to Katherine so quickly that her head spun. "Why? Why did 
you do that?" 


Katherine smiled, showing pointed white teeth. "Because I love him," she said in a 
childish singsong. "Don't you love him, too?" 


It was only then that Elena fully realized why she couldn't move, and why her 
arms hurt. She was tied up like Stefan, lashed securely to the closed gate. A painful

turning of her head to the other side revealed Damon. 


"Which one do you like better?" Katherine asked, in an intimate, confiding tone. 
"You can tell me. Which one do you think is best?" 


Elena looked at her, sickened. "Katherine," she whispered. "Please. Please listen 
to me... 


"Tell me. Go on." Those jewel blue eyes filled Elena's vision as Katherine leaned 
in close, her lips almost touching Elena's. "I think they're both fun. Do you like fun, 
Elena?" 


Revolted, Elena shut her eyes and turned her face away. If only her head would 
stop spinning. 


Katherine stepped back with a clear laugh. "I know, it's so hard to choose." She 
did a little pirouette, and Elena saw that what she had vaguely taken for the train to 
Katherine's dress was Katherine's hair. It flowed like molten gold down her back to 
spill over the floor, trailing behind her. 


"It all depends on your taste," Katherine continued, doing a few graceful dance 
steps and ending up in front of Damon. She looked over at Elena impishly. "But then 
I have such a sweet tooth." She grasped Damon by the hair, and, yanking his head 
up, sank her teeth into his neck. 


04 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
"No! Don't do that; don't hurt him any more..." Elena tried to surge forward, but 
she was tied too tightly. The gate was solid iron, set in stone, and the ropes were 
sturdy. Katherine was making animal sounds, gnawing and chewing at the flesh, and 
Damon moaned even in unconsciousness. Elena saw his body jerk reflexively with 
pain. 

"Please stop; oh, please stop-" 

Katherine lifted her head. Blood was running down her chin. "But I'm hungry and 
he's so good," she said. She reared back and struck again, and Damon's body 
spasmed. Elena cried out. 

I was like that, she thought. In the beginning, that first night in the woods, I was 
like that. I hurt Stefan like that, I wanted to kill him... 

Darkness swept up around her, and she gave in to it gratefully. 

Alaric's car skewed on a patch of ice as it reached the school, and Meredith 
almost ran into it. She and Matt jumped out of her car, leaving the doors open. 
Ahead, Alaric and Bonnie did the same. 

"What about the rest of the town?" Meredith shouted, running toward them. The 
wind was rising, and her face burned with frost. 


"Just Elena's family-Aunt Judith and Margaret," Bonnie cried. Her voice was 
shrill and frightened, but there was a look of concentration in her eyes. She leaned 
her head back as if trying to remember something, and said, "Yes, that's it. They're 
the other ones the dogs will be after. Make them go somewhere-like the cellar. 
Keep them there!" "I'll do it. You three take the dance!" Bonnie turned to run after 
Alaric. Meredith raced back to her car.

Alaric. Meredith raced back to her car. 

"Go back in! Get everybody inside and shut the doors!" he yelled at the sheriff's 
officers. 

But there wasn't time. He reached the cafeteria just as the first lurking shape in the 
darkness did. One officer went down without a sound or a chance to fire his gun. 

Another was quicker, and a gunshot rang out, amplified by the concrete 
courtyard. Students screamed and began to run away from it, into the parking lot. 
Alaric went after them, yelling, trying to herd them back. 

Other shapes came out of the darkness, from between parked cars, from all sides. 

05 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
Panic ensued. Alaric kept shouting, kept trying to gather the terrified students toward 
the building. Out here they were easy prey. 


In the courtyard, Bonnie turned to Matt. "We need fire!" she said. Matt darted 
into the cafeteria and came out with a box half-full of dance programs. He threw it to 
the ground, groping in his pockets for one of the matches they'd used to light the 
candle before. 


The paper caught and burned brightly. It formed an island of safety. Matt 
continued to wave people into the cafeteria doors behind it. Bonnie plunged inside, 
to find a scene just as riotous as outside. 


She looked around for someone in authority but couldn't see any adults, only 
panicked kids. Then the red and green crepe paper decorations caught her eye. 


The noise was thunderous; even a shout couldn't be heard in here. Struggling past 
the people trying to get out, she made it to the far side of the room. Caroline was 
there, looking pale without her summer tan, and wearing the snow queen tiara. 
Bonnie towed her to the microphone. 


"You're good at talking. Tell them to get inside and stay in! Tell them to start 
taking down the decorations. We need anything that'll burn-wood chairs, stuff in 
garbage cans, anything. Tell them it's our only chance!" She added, as Caroline 
stared at her, frightened and uncomprehending: "You've got the crown on now-so 
do something with it!" 


She didn't wait to see Caroline obey. She plunged again into the furor of the 
room. A moment later she heard Caroline's voice, first hesitant and then urgent, on 
the loudspeakers. 


. 
It was dead quiet when Elena opened her eyes again. 


It was dead quiet when Elena opened her eyes again. 


At the hoarse whisper, she tried to focus and found herself looking into pain-filled 
green eyes. 


"Stefan," she said. She leaned toward him yearningly, wishing she could move. It 
didn't make sense, but she felt that if they could only hold each other it wouldn't be 
so bad. 


There was a childish laugh. Elena didn't turn toward it, but Stefan did. Elena saw 
his reaction, saw the sequence of expressions passing across his face almost too 
quickly to identify. Blank shock, disbelief, dawning joy-and then horror. A horror 
that finally turned his eyes blind and opaque. 


"Katherine," he said. "But that's impossible. It can't be. You're dead..." 


"Stefan..." Elena said, but he didn't respond. 


06 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
Katherine put a hand in front of her mouth and giggled behind it. 

"You wake up, too," she said, looking on the other side of Elena. Elena felt a 
surge of Power. After a moment Damon's head lifted slowly, and he blinked. 

There was no astonishment in his face. He leaned his head back, eyes wearily 
narrowed, and looked for a minute or so at his captor. Then he smiled, a faint and 
painful smile, but recognizable. 

"Our sweet little white kitten," he whispered. "I should have known." 

"You didn't know, though, did you?" Katherine said, as eager as a child playing a 
game. "Even you didn't guess. I fooled everyone." She laughed again. "It was so 
much fun, watching you while you were watching Stefan, and neither of you knew I 
was there. I even scratched you once!" Hooking her fingers into claws, she 
mimicked a kitten's slash. 

"At Elena's house. Yes, I remember," Damon said slowly. He didn't seem so 
much angry as vaguely, whimsically amused. "Well, you're certainly a hunter. The 
lady and the tiger, as it were." 

"And I put Stefan in that well," Katherine bragged. "I saw you two fighting; I liked 
that. I followed Stefan to the edge of the woods, and then-" She clapped her 
cupped hands together, like someone catching a moth. Opening them slowly, she 
peered down into them as if she really had something there, and giggled secretly. "I 
was going to keep him to play with," she confided. Then her lower lip thrust out and 
she looked at Elena balefully. "But you took him. That was mean, Elena. You 
shouldn't have done that." 

The dreadful childish slyness was gone from her face, and for a moment Elena 
glimpsed the searing hatred of a woman. 

"Greedy girls get punished," Katherine said, moving toward her, "and you're a 


greedy girl." 

greedy girl." 

Distracted, Katherine stepped back. She looked surprised, then flattered. 

"Well-if you really want me to," she said. She hugged her elbows with her hands 
and pirouetted again, her golden hair twisting on the floor. "No," she said gleefully, 
turning back and pointing at them. "You guess. You guess and I'll tell you 'right' or 
'wrong.' Go on! 

Elena swallowed, casting a covert glance at Stefan. She didn't see the point of 
stalling Katherine; it was all going to come out the same in the end. But some instinct 
told her to hang on to life as long as she could. 

"You attacked Vickie," she said, carefully. Her own voice sounded winded to her 

07 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
ears, but she was positive now. "The girl in the ruined church that night." 

"Good! Yes," Katherine cried. She made another kitten swipe with clawed 
fingers. "Well, after all, she was in my church," she added reasonably. "And what 
she and that boy were doing-well! You don't do that in church. So, I scratched 
her!" Katherine drew out the word, demonstrating, like somebody telling a story to a 
young child. "And... I licked the blood up!" She licked pale pink lips with her 
tongue. Then she pointed at Stefan. "Next guess!" 

"You've been hounding her ever since," Stefan said. He wasn't playing the game; 
he was making a sickened observation. 

"Yes, we're done with that! Go on to something else," Katherine said sharply. But 
then she fiddled with the buttons at the neck of her dress, her fingers twinkling. And 
Elena thought of Vickie, with her startled-fawn eyes, undressing in the cafeteria in 
front of everyone. "I made her do silly things." Katherine laughed. "She was fun to 
play with." 

Elena's arms were numb and cramped. She realized that she was reflexively 
straining against the ropes, so offended by Katherine's words that she couldn't hold 
still. She made herself stop, trying instead to lean back and get a little feeling into her 
deadened hands. What she was going to do if she got free she didn't know, but she 
had to try. 

"Next guess," Katherine was saying dangerously. 

"Why do you say it's your church?" Damon asked. His voice was still distantly 
amused, as if none of this affected him at all. "What about Honoria Fell?" 

"Oh, that old spook!" Katherine said maliciously. She peered around behind 
Elena, her mouth pursed, her eyes glaring. Elena realized for the first time that they 
were facing the entrance to the crypt, with the ransacked tomb behind them. Maybe 
Honoria would help them... 

But then she remembered that quiet, fading voice. This is the only help I can give 
you. And she knew that no further aid would come. 


As if she'd read Elena's thoughts, Katherine was saying, "She can't do anything. 
She's just a pack of old bones." The graceful hands made gestures as if Katherine 
were breaking those bones. "All she can do is talk, and lots of times I stopped you 
from hearing her." Katherine's expression was dark again, and Elena felt an acid 
twinge of fear.

"Yes! That was funny. You all came running out of the house and started 

08 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
moaning and crying..." Katherine evoked the scene in pantomime: the little dog lying 
in front of Bonnie's house, the girls rushing out to find his body. "He tasted bad, but 
it was worth it. I followed Damon there when he was a crow. I used to follow him a 
lot. If I wanted I could have grabbed that crow, and..." She made a sharp wringing 
motion. 

Bonnie's dream, thought Elena, icy revelation sweeping over her. She didn't even 
realize she'd spoken aloud until she saw Stefan and Katherine looking at her. "Bonnie 
dreamed about you," she whispered. "But she thought it was me. She told me that 
she saw me standing under a tree with the wind blowing. And she was afraid of me. 
She said I looked different, pale but almost glowing. And a crow flew by and I 
grabbed it and wrung its neck." Bile was rising in Elena's throat, and she gulped it 
down. "But it was you," she said. 

Katherine looked delighted, as if Elena had somehow proved her point. "People 
dream about me a lot," she said smugly. "Your aunt-she's dreamed about me. I tell 
her it was her fault you died. She thinks it's you telling her." 

"Oh, God..." 

"I wish you had died," Katherine went on, her face turning spiteful. "You should 
have died. I kept you in the river long enough. But you were such a tramp, getting 
blood from both of them, that you came back. Oh, well." She gave a furtive smile. 
"Now I can play with you longer. I lost my temper that day, because I saw Stefan 
had given you my ring. My ring!" Her voice rose. "Mine, that I left for them to 
remember me by. And he gave it to you. That was when I knew I wasn't just going to 
play with him. I had to kill him." 

Stefan's eyes were stricken, confounded. "But I thought you were dead," he said. 
"You were dead, five hundred years ago. Katherine..." 

"Oh, that was the first time I fooled you," Katherine said, but there was no glee in 
her tone now. It was sullen. "I arranged it all with Gudren, my maid. The two of you 
wouldn't accept my choice," she burst out, looking from Stefan to Damon angrily. "I 
wanted us all to be happy; I loved you. I loved you both. But that wasn't good 
enough for you." 

Katherine's face had changed again, and Elena saw in it the hurt child of five 
centuries ago. That must have been what Katherine looked like, then, she thought 
wonderingly. The wide blue eyes were actually filling with tears. 

"I wanted you to love each other." 


Katherine went on, sounding bewildered, "but you wouldn't. And I felt awful. I 
thought if you thought I'd died, that you would love each other. And I knew I had to 
go away, anyway, before Papa started to suspect what I was. 

Katherine went on, sounding bewildered, "but you wouldn't. And I felt awful. I

09 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
"But then"-Katherine's face twisted in grief-"you did everything all wrong. 
You were supposed to be sorry, and cry, and comfort each other. I did it for you. 
But instead you ran and got swords. Why did you do that?" It was a cry from the 
heart. "Why didn't you take my gift? You treated it like garbage. I told you in the 
note that I wanted you to be reconciled with each other. But you didn't listen and 
you got swords. You killed each other. Why did you do it?" 


Tears were slipping down Katherine's cheeks, and Stefan's face was wet, too. 
"We were stupid," he said, as caught up in the memory of the past as she was. "We 
blamed each other for your death, and we were so stupid... Katherine, listen to me. 
It was my fault; I was the one who attacked first. And I've been sorry-you don't 
know how sorry I've been ever since. You don't know how many times I've thought 
about it and wished there was something I could do to change it. I'd have given 
anything to take it back-anything. I killed my brother..." His voice cracked, and 
tears spilled from his eyes. Elena, her heart breaking with grief, turned helplessly to 
Damon and saw that he wasn't even aware of her. The look of amusement was gone, 
and his eyes were fixed on Stefan in utter concentration, riveted. 


"Katherine, please listen to me," Stefan said shakily, regaining his voice. "We've 
all hurt one another enough. Please let us go now. Or keep me, if you want, but let 
them leave. I'm the one that's to blame. Keep me, and I'll do whatever you want..." 


Katherine's jewel-like eyes were liquid and impossibly blue, filled with an endless 
sorrow. Elena didn't dare to breathe, afraid to break the spell as the slender girl 
moved toward Stefan, her face softened and yearning. 


But then the ice inside Katherine crept out again, freezing the tears on her cheeks. 
"You should have thought of that a long time ago," she said. "I might have listened 
to you then. I was sorry you'd killed each other at first. I ran away, without even 
Gudren, back to my home. But then I didn't have anything, not even a new dress, 
and I was hungry and cold. I might have starved if Klaus hadn't found me." 


Klaus. Through her dismay, Elena remembered something Stefan had told her. 
Klaus was the man who'd made Katherine a vampire, the man the villagers said was 
evil. 


"Klaus taught me the truth," Katherine said. "He showed me how the world really 
is. You have to be strong, and take the things you want. You have to think only of 
yourself. And I'm the strongest of all now. I am. You know how I got that way?" 
She answered the question without even waiting for them to respond. "Lives. So

many lives. Humans and vampires, and they're all inside me now. I killed Klaus after 
a century or two. He was surprised. He didn't know how much I'd learned.

"I brought you here, both of you. I put the thought in your mind, Stefan, the way 
you put thoughts into a human's. I guided you to this place. And then I made sure 


10 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
Damon followed you. Elena was here. I think she must be related to me somehow; 
she looks like me. I knew you'd see her and feel guilty. But you weren't supposed to 
fall in love with her!" The resentfulness in Katherine's voice gave way to fury again. 
"You weren't supposed to forget me! You weren't supposed to give her my ring!" 

"Katherine..." 

Katherine swept on. "Oh, you made me so angry. And now I'm going to make 
you sorry, really sorry. I know who I hate most now, and it's you, Stefan. Because I 
loved you best." She seemed to regain control of herself, wiping the last traces of 
tears from her face and drawing herself up with exaggerated dignity. 

"I don't hate Damon as much," she said. "I might even let him live." Her eyes 
narrowed, and then widened with an idea. "Listen, Damon," she said secretly. 
"You're not as stupid as Stefan is. You know the way things really are. I've heard 
you say it. I've seen things you've done." She leaned forward. "I've been lonely since 
Klaus died. You could keep me company. All you have to do is say you love me 
best. Then after I kill them we'll go away. You can even kill the girl if you want. I'd 
let you. What do you think?" 

Oh, God, thought Elena, sickened again. Damon's eyes were on Katherine's wide 
blue ones; he seemed to be searching her face. And the whimsical amusement was 
back in his expression. Oh, God, no, Elena thought. Please, no... 

Slowly, Damon smiled. 


Fifteen 

Elena watched Damon with mute dread. She knew that disturbing smile too well. 
But even as her heart sank, her mind threw a mocking question at her. What 
difference did it make? She and Stefan were going to die anyway. It only made sense 
for Damon to save himself. And it was wrong to expect him to go against his nature. 

She watched that beautiful, capricious smile with a feeling of sorrow for what 
Damon might have been. 

Katherine smiled back at him, enchanted. "We'll be so happy together. Once 
they're dead, I'll let you go. I didn't mean to hurt you, not really. I just got angry." 
She put out a slender hand and stroked his cheek. "I'm sorry." 

"Katherine," he said. He was still smiling. 

"Yes." She leaned closer. 

"Katherine..." 

"Yes, Damon?" 

"Go to hell."

L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
Elena flinched from what happened next before it happened, feeling the violent 
upsurge of Power, of malevolent, unbridled Power. She screamed at the change in 
Katherine. That lovely face was twisting, mutating into something that was neither 
human nor animal. A red light blazed in Katherine's eyes as she fell on Damon, her 
fangs sinking into his throat. 

Talons sprang from her fingertips, and she raked Damon's already-bleeding chest 
with it, tearing into his skin while the blood flowed. Elena kept screaming, realizing 
dimly that the pain in her arms was from fighting the ropes that held her. She heard 
Stefan shouting, too, but above everything she heard the deafening shriek of 
Katherine's mental voice. 

Now you'll be sorry! Now I'm going to make you sorry! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! 
I'll kill you! I'll kill you! 

The words themselves hurt, like daggers stabbing into Elena's mind. The sheer 
Power of it stupefied her, rocking her back against the iron pickets. But there was no 
way to get away from it. It seemed to echo from all around her, hammering in her 
skull. 

Kill you! Kill you! Kill you! 

Elena fainted. 

Meredith, crouched beside Aunt Judith in the utility room, shifted her weight, 
straining to interpret the sounds outside the door. The dogs had gotten into the 
cellar; she wasn't sure how, but from the bloody muzzles of some of them, she 


thought they had broken through the ground-level windows. Now they were outside 
the utility room, but Meredith couldn't tell what they were doing. It was too quiet out 
there. 

thought they had broken through the ground-level windows. Now they were outside 
the utility room, but Meredith couldn't tell what they were doing. It was too quiet out 
there. 

"Hush," Robert whispered quickly. "It's all right, sweetheart. Everything's going 
to be all right." 

Meredith met his frightened, determined eyes over Margaret's tow head. We 
almost had you pegged for the Other Power, she thought. But there was no time to 
regret it now. 

"Where's Elena? Elena said she'd watch over me," Margaret said, her eyes large 
and solemn. "She said she'd take care of me." Aunt Judith put a hand to her mouth. 

"She is taking care of you," Meredith whispered. "She just sent me to do it, that's 
all. It's the truth," she added fiercely, and saw Robert's look of reproach melt into 
perplexity. 

12 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
Outside, the silence had given way to scratching and gnawing sounds. The dogs 
were at work on the door. 

Robert cradled Margaret's head closer to his chest. 

Bonnie didn't know how long they had been working. Hours, certainly. Forever, it 
seemed like. The dogs had gotten in through the kitchen and the old wooden side 
doors. So far, though, only about a dozen had gotten past the fires lit like barricades 
in front of these openings. And the men with guns had taken care of most of those. 

But Mr. Smallwood and his friends were now holding empty rifles. And they were 
running out of things to burn. 

Vickie had gotten hysterical a little while ago, screaming and holding her head as if 
something was hurting her. They'd been looking for ways to restrain her when she 
finally passed out. 

Bonnie went up to Matt, who was looking out over the fire through the 
demolished side door. He wasn't looking for dogs, she knew, but for something else 
much farther away. Something you couldn't see from here. 

"You had to go, Matt," she said. "There was nothing else you could do." He 
didn't answer or turn around. 

"It's almost dawn," she said. "Maybe when that comes, the dogs will leave." But 
even as she said it, she knew it wasn't true. 

Matt didn't answer. She touched his shoulder. "Stefan's with her. Stefan's there." 

At last, Matt gave some response. He nodded. "Stefan's there," he said. 

Brown and snarling, another shape charged out of the dark. 


It was much later when Elena came gradually to consciousness. She knew 
because she could see, not just by the handful of candles Katherine had lit but also 
by the cold gray dimness that filtered down from the crypt's opening. 

It was much later when Elena came gradually to consciousness. She knew

by the cold gray dimness that filtered down from the crypt's opening. 

Damon? she thought. It was only after she had done it that she realized the word 
had not been spoken. Somehow, Katherine's shrieking had closed a circuit in her 
mind, or maybe it had awakened something sleeping. And Matt's blood had 
undoubtedly helped, giving her the strength to finally find her mental voice. 

She turned her head the other way. Stefan? 

His face was haggard with pain, but aware. Too aware. Elena almost wished that 

13 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
he were as insensible as Damon to what was happening to them. 
Elena, he returned. 
Where is she? Elena said, her eyes moving slowly around the room. 
Stefan looked toward the opening of the crypt. She went up there a while ago. 


Maybe to check on how the dogs are doing. 


Elena had thought she'd reached the limit of fear and dread, but it wasn't true. She 
hadn't remembered the others then. 
Elena, I'm sorry. Stefan's face was filled with what no words could express. 
It's not your fault, Stefan. You didn't do this to her. She did it to herself. Or-it 


just happened to her, because of what she is. What we are. Running beneath 
Elena's thoughts was the memory of how she had attacked Stefan in the woods, and 
how she had felt when she was racing toward Mr. Smallwood, planning her revenge. 
It could have been me, she said. 

No! You could never become like that. 
Elena didn't answer. If she had the Power now, what would she do to Katherine? 


What wouldn't she do to her? But she knew it would only upset Stefan more to talk 
about it. 
I thought Damon was going to betray us, she said. 
I did, too, said Stefan queerly. He was looking at his brother with an odd 


expression. 
Do you still hate him? 
Stefan's gaze darkened. No, he said quietly. No, I don't hate him anymore. 
Elena nodded. It was important, somehow. Then she started, her nerves 
hyper-alert, as something shadowed the entrance to the crypt. Stefan tensed, too. 
She's coming. Elena-
I love you, Stefan, Elena said hopelessly, as the misty white shape hurtled down. 
. 


Katherine took form in front of them. 
Katherine took form in front of them. 
Of course, thought Elena. How could I have been so stupid? Damon rode with us 


in Alaric's car over the river. He crossed running water then, and probably lots of 
other times. He couldn't have been the Other Power. 

14 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
It was strange how she could think even though she was so frightened. It was as if 
one part of her mind stood watching from a distance. 


"I'm going to kill you now," Katherine said conversationally. "Then I'm going 
under the river to kill your friends. I don't think the dogs have done it yet. But I'll 
take care of it myself." 


"Let Elena go," said Stefan. His voice was quenched but compelling all the same. 


"I haven't decided how to do it," said Katherine, ignoring him. "I might roast you. 
There's almost enough light for that now. And I've got these." She reached down the 
front of her gown and brought her closed hand out. "One-two-three!" she said, 
dropping two silver rings and a gold one onto the ground. Their stones shone blue 
as Katherine's eyes, blue as the stone in the necklace at Katherine's throat. 


Elena's hands twisted frantically and she felt the smooth bareness of her ring 
finger. It was true. She wouldn't have believed how naked she felt without that circlet 
of metal. It was necessary to her life, to her survival. Without it-


"Without these you'll die," Katherine said, scuffing the rings carelessly with the 
toe of one foot. "But I don't know if that's slow enough." She paced back almost to 
the far wall of the crypt, her silver dress shimmering in the dim light. 


It was then that the idea came to Elena. 


She could move her hands. Enough to feel one with the other, enough to know 
that they weren't numb anymore. The ropes were looser. 


But Katherine was strong. Unbelievably strong. And faster than Elena, too. Even 
if Elena got free she would have time for only one quick act. 


She rotated one wrist, feeling the ropes give. 


"There are other ways," Katherine said. "I could cut you and watch you bleed. I 
like watching." 


Gritting her teeth, Elena exerted pressure against the rope. Her hand was bent at 
an excruciating angle, but she continued to press. She felt the burn of the rope 
slipping aside. 


"Or rats," Katherine was saying pensively. "Rats could be fun. I could tell them 
when to start and when to stop." 


. 
Working the other hand free was much easier. Elena tried to give no sign of what 
was going on behind her back. She would have liked to call to Stefan with her mind, 
but she didn't dare. Not if there was any chance Katherine might hear.

15 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
but she didn't dare. Not if there was any chance Katherine might hear. 

There was a rectangle of gray light on the floor. Dawn light. It was coming in 
through the crypt's opening. Katherine had already been out in that light. But... 

Katherine smiled suddenly, her blue eyes sparkling. "I know! I'll drink you almost 
up and make you watch while I kill her! I'll leave you just enough strength so you see 
her die before you do. Doesn't that sound like a good plan?" Blithely, she clapped 
her hands and pirouetted again, dancing away. 

Just one more step, thought Elena. She saw Katherine approach the rectangle of 
light. Just one more step... 

Katherine took the step. "That's it, then!" She started to turn around. "What a 
good-" 

Now! 

Yanking her cramped arms out of the last loops of rope, Elena rushed her. It was 
like the rush of a hunting cat. One desperate sprint to reach the prey. One chance. 
One hope. 

She struck Katherine with her full weight. The impact knocked them both into the 
rectangle of light. She felt Katherine's head crack against the stone floor. 

And felt the searing pain, as if her own body had been plunged into poison. It was 
a feeling like the burning dryness of hunger, only stronger. A thousand times 
stronger. It was unbearable. 

"Elena!" Stefan screamed, with mind and voice. 

Stefan, she thought. Beneath her Power surged as Katherine's stunned eyes 
focused. Her mouth twisted with rage, fangs bursting forth. They were so long they 
cut into the lower lip. That distorted mouth opened in a howl. 

Elena's clumsy hand fumbled at Katherine's throat. Her fingers closed on the cool 
metal of Katherine's blue necklace. With all her strength, she wrenched and felt the 
chain give way. She tried to clasp it, but her fingers felt thick and uncoordinated and 
Katherine's clawing hand scrabbled at it wildly. It spun away into the shadows. 

"Elena!" Stefan called again in that dreadful voice. 

She felt as if her body were filled with light. As if she were transparent. Only, light 
was pain. Beneath her, Katherine's warped face was looking up directly into the 
winter sky. Instead of a howl, there was a shrieking that went up and up. 

Elena tried to lift herself off, but she didn't have the strength. Katherine's face was 
rifting, cracking open. Lines of fire opened in it. The screaming reached a 
crescendo. Katherine's hair was aflame, her skin was blackening. Elena felt fire from

both above and below. 

both above and below. 

She saw Stefan's arms, red where they had been exposed to the sun and bleeding 
where he had torn free of his ropes. She saw his face, saw the stricken horror and 
grief. Then her eyes blurred and she saw nothing. 

Meredith and Robert, striking at the blood-soaked muzzles that thrust through the 
hole in the door, paused in confusion. The teeth had stopped snapping and tearing. 
One muzzle jerked and slid out of the way. Edging sideways to look at the other, 
Meredith saw that the dog's eyes were glazed and milky. They didn't move. She 
looked at Robert, who stood panting. 

There was no more noise from the cellar. Everything was silent. 

But they didn't dare to hope. 

Vickie's demented shrieking stopped as if it had been cut with a knife. The dog, 
which had sunk its teeth into Matt's thigh, stiffened and gave a convulsive shudder; 
then, its jaws released him. Gasping for breath, Bonnie swung to look beyond the 
dying fire. There was just enough light to see bodies of other dogs lying where they 
had fallen outside. 

She and Matt leaned on each other, looking around, bewildered. 

It had finally stopped snowing. 

Slowly, Elena opened her eyes. 

Everything was very clear and calm. 

She was glad the shrieking was over. That had been bad; it had hurt. Now, 
nothing hurt. She felt as if her body were filled with light again, but this time there 
was no pain. It was as if she were floating, very high and easy, on wafts of air. She 
almost felt she didn't have a body at all. 

She smiled. 

Turning her head didn't hurt, although it increased the loose, floating feeling. She 
saw, in the oblong of pale light on the floor, the smoldering remains of a silvery 
dress. Katherine's lie of five hundred years ago had become the truth. 

That was that, then. Elena looked away. She didn't wish anyone harm now, and 
she didn't want to waste time on Katherine. There were so many more important 
things. 

"Stefan," she said and sighed, and smiled. Oh, this was nice. This must be how a 
bird felt. 

"I didn't mean for things to turn out this way," she said, softly rueful. His green 

17 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
eyes were wet. They filled again, but he returned her smile. 


. 
"I know," he said. "I know, Elena." 
"I know," he said. "I know, Elena." 
It seemed to her that it had been a long while since she'd really looked at him. 


Since she'd taken time to appreciate how beautiful he was, with his dark hair and his 
eyes as green as oak leaves. But she saw it now, and she saw his soul shining 
through those eyes. It was worth it, she thought. I didn't want to die; I don't want to 
now. But I'd do it all over again if I had to. 

"I love you," she whispered. 
"I love you," he said, squeezing their joined hands. 
The strange, languorous lightness cradled her gently. She could scarcely feel 


Stefan holding her. 


She would have thought she'd be terrified. But she wasn't, not as long as Stefan 
was there. 
"The people at the dance-they'll be all right now, won't they?" she said. 
"They'll be all right now," Stefan whispered. "You saved them." 
"I didn't get to say good-bye to Bonnie and Meredith. Or Aunt Judith. You have 


to tell them I love them." 
"I'll tell them," Stefan said. 
"You can tell them yourself," panted another voice, hoarse and unused sounding. 


Damon had pulled himself across the floor behind Stefan. His face was ravaged, 
streaked with blood, but his dark eyes burned at her. "Use your will, Elena. Hold on. 
You have the strength-" 

She smiled at him, waveringly. She knew the truth. What was happening was only 
finishing what had been started two weeks ago. She'd had thirteen days to get things 
straight, to make amends with Matt and say good-bye to Margaret. To tell Stefan she 
loved him. But now the grace period was up. 

Still, there was no point in hurting Damon. She loved Damon, too. "I'll try," she 
promised. 
"We'll take you home," he said. 


"But not yet," she told him gently. "Let's wait just a little while." 
Something happened in the fathomless black eyes, and the burning spark went 
out. Then she saw that Damon knew, too.

L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
"I'm not afraid," she said. "Well-only a little." A drowsiness had started, and 
she felt very comfortable, but as if she were falling asleep. Things were drifting away 
from her. 

An ache rose in her chest. She was not much afraid, but she was sorry. There 

were so many things she would miss, so many things she wished she had done. 
. 
"Oh," she said softly. "How funny." 


"Oh," she said softly. "How funny." 
underground room. Only this was a doorway into a different light. 
"How beautiful," she murmured. "Stefan? I'm so tired." 
"You can rest now," he whispered. 
"You won't let go of me?" 
"No." 
"Then I won't be afraid." 
Something was shining on Damon's face. She reached toward it, touched it, and 


lifted her fingers away in wonder. 
"Don't be sad," she told him, feeling the cool wetness on her fingertips. But a 
pang of worry disturbed her. Who was there to understand Damon now? Who 
would be there to push him, to try to see what was really inside him? "You have to 

take care of each other," she said, realizing it. A little strength came back to her, like 
a candle flaring in the wind. "Stefan, will you promise? Promise to take care of each 
other?" 
"I promise," he said. "Oh, Elena..." 
Waves of sleepiness were overcoming her. "That's good," she said. "That's 
good, Stefan." 


The doorway was closer, so close she could touch it now. She wondered if her 
parents were somewhere behind it. 
"Time to go home," she whispered. 
And then the darkness and the shadows faded and there was nothing but light. 
Stefan held her while her eyes closed. And then he just held her, the tears he'd 


been keeping back falling without restraint. It was a different pain than when he'd 


19 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
pulled her out of the river. There was no anger in this, and no hatred, but a love that 
seemed to go on and on forever. 
It hurt even more. 
He looked at the rectangle of sunlight, just a step or two away from him. Elena 
had gone into the light. She'd left him here alone. 
Not for long, he thought. 
His ring was on the floor. He didn't even glance at it as he rose, his eyes on the 
shaft of sunlight shining down. 
A hand grabbed his arm and pulled him back. 
Stefan looked into his brother's face. 


Damon's eyes were dark as midnight, and he was holding Stefan's ring. As Stefan 

watched, unable to move, he forced the ring onto Stefan's finger and released him.

yours, too. Take it. Take it and go." He turned his face away. 
Stefan gazed at the golden circlet in his palm for a long time. 
Then his fingers closed over it and he looked back at Damon. His brother's eyes 
were shut, his breathing labored. He looked exhausted and in pain. 
And Stefan had made a promise to Elena. 
"Come on," he said quietly, putting the ring in his pocket. "Let's get you some 
place where you can rest." 
He put an arm around his brother to help him up. And then, for a moment, he just 


held on. 

Sixteen 

December 16, Monday 

Stefan gave this to me. He's given most of the things in his room away. I said I 
didn't want it at first, because I didn't know what to do with it. But now I think I 

20 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
have an idea. 


People are starting to forget already. They're getting the details wrong, and 
adding things they just imagined. And, most of all, they're making up 
explanations. Why it wasn't really supernatural, why there's a rational reason for 
this or that. It's just silly, but there's no way to stop them, especially the adults. 


They're the worst. They're saying the dogs were hydrophobic or something. The 
vet's come up with a new name for it, some kind of rabies that's spread by bats. 
Meredith says that's ironic. I think it's just stupid. 


The kids are a little better, especially the ones who were at the dance. There are 
some I think we can rely on, like Sue Carson and Vickie. Vickie's changed so much 
in the last two days that it's like a miracle. She's not the way she's been for the last 
two and a half months, but she's not the way she used to be, either. She used to be 
pretty much of a bimbo, running around with the tough crowd. But now I think 
she's okay. 


Even Caroline wasn't so bad today. She didn't talk at the other service, but she 
talked at this one. She said Elena was the real snow queen, which was kind of 
cribbing off of Sue's speech from before, but probably the best Caroline could do. 
It was a nice gesture. 


Elena looked so peaceful. Not like a wax doll, but as if she were sleeping. I 
know everybody says that, but it's true. This time, it really is true. 


But afterward people were talking about "her remarkable escape from 
drowning" and stuff like that. And saying she died of an embolism or something. 
Which is absolutely ridiculous. But that's what gave me the idea. 


I'm going to get her other diary out of her closet. And then I'm going to ask Mrs. 
Grimesby to put them in the library, not in a case like Honoria Fell's, but where 
people can pick them up and read them. Because the truth is in here. This is 
where the real story is. And I don't want anybody to forget it. 


I think maybe the kids will remember. 


I suppose I should put what happened to the rest of the people around here; 
Elena would want that. Aunt Judith is okay, although she's one of the adults who 
can't deal with the truth. She needs a rational explanation. She and Robert are 
going to get married at Christmas. That should be good for Margaret. 


Margaret's got the right idea. She told me at the service that she's going to go 
see Elena and her parents someday, but not now, because there were a lot of 
things she still had to do right here. I don't know what put that idea into her head. 


. 
She's smart for a four-year-old. 


She's smart for a four-year-old.

L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
Typical, absolutely typical. Everybody else gets the guys. I'm thinking of trying 
one of my grandmother's rituals, just to see if I'll ever get married at all. There 
isn't even anybody I want to marry around here. 

Well, there's Matt. Matt's nice. But right now he's only got one girl on his mind. 
I don't know if that will ever change. 

He punched Tyler in the nose after the service today, because Tyler said 
something off-color about her. Tyler is one person I know will never change, no 
matter what. He'll always be the mean, obnoxious jerk he is now. 

But Matt-well, Matt's eyes are awfully blue. And he's got a terrific right hook. 

Stefan couldn't hit Tyler because he wasn't there. There are still plenty of people 
in town who think he killed Elena. He must have, they say, because there was 
nobody else there. Katherine's ashes were scattered all over by the time the 
rescuers got to the crypt. Stefan says it's because she was so old that she flamed up 
like that. He says he should have realized the first time, when Katherine pretended 
to burn, that a young vampire wouldn't turn to ashes that way. She'd just die, like 
Elena. Only the old ones crumble. 

Some people-especially Mr. Smallwood and his friends-would probably 
blame Damon if they could get hold of him. But they can't. He wasn't there when 
they reached the tomb, because Stefan helped him get away. Stefan won't say 
where, but I think to someplace in the woods. Vampires must heal fast because 
today when I met him after the service, Stefan said that Damon had left Fell's 
Church. He wasn't happy about it; I think Damon didn't tell him. Now the 
question seems to be: What is Damon doing? Out biting innocent girls? Or is he 
reformed? I wouldn't lay bets on it either way. Damon was a strange guy. 

But gorgeous. Definitely gorgeous. 

Stefan won't say where he's going, either. But I have a sneaking suspicion 
Damon may get a surprise if he looks behind him. Apparently, Elena made Stefan 
promise to watch out for him or something. And Stefan takes promises very, very 
seriously. 

I wish him luck. But he'll be doing what Elena wanted him to, which I think 
will make him happy. As happy as he can be here without her. He's wearing her 
ring on a chain around his neck now. 

If you think any of this sounds frivolous or as if I don't care about Elena, that 
just shows how wrong you are. I dare anybody to say that to me. Meredith and I 
cried all day Saturday, and most of Sunday. And I was so angry I wanted to rip 
things apart and break them. I kept thinking, why Elena? Why? When there were 


so many other people who could have died that night. Out of the whole town, she 
was the only one. 

so many other people who could have died that night. Out of the whole town, she 

22 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 03 - The Fury 
was the only one. 

Oh, I'm starting to cry again. That's what happens when you think about life 
being fair. And I can't explain why it isn't. I'd like to go bang on Honoria Fell's 
tomb and ask her if she can explain, but she wouldn't talk to me. I don't think it's 
something anybody knows. 

I loved Elena. And I'm going to miss her terribly. The whole school is. It's like a 
light that's gone out. Robert says that's what her name means in Latin, "light." 

Now there'll always be a part of me where the light has gone away. 

I wish I'd been able to say good-bye to her, but Stefan says she sent her love to 
me. I'm going to try to think of that as a light to take with me. 

I'd better stop writing now. Stefan's leaving, and Matt and Meredith and Alaric 
and I are going to see him off. I didn't mean to get so into this; I've never kept a 
journal myself. But I want people to know the truth about Elena. She wasn't a 
saint. She wasn't always sweet and good and honest and agreeable. But she was 
strong and loving and loyal to her friends, and in the end she did the most 
unselfish thing anybody could do. Meredith says it means she chose light over 
darkness. I want people to know that so they'll always remember. 

I always will.

"Things can be just like they were before," said Caroline warmly, reaching out to 
squeeze Bonnie's hand. 


But it wasn't true. Nothing could ever be the way it had been before Elena died. 
Nothing. And Bonnie had serious misgivings about this party Caroline was trying to 
set up. A vague nagging in the pit of her stomach told her that for some reason it 
was a very, very bad idea. 


"Meredith's birthday is already over," she pointed out. "It was last Saturday." 


"But she didn't have a party, not a real party like this one. We've got all night; my 
parents won't be back until Sunday morning. Come on, Bonnie-just think how 
surprised she'll be." 


Oh, she'll be surprised, all right, thought Bonnie. So surprised she just might kill 
me afterward. "Look, Caroline, the reason Meredith didn't have a big party is that 
she still doesn't feel much like celebrating. It seems-disrespectful, somehow-" 


"But that's wrong. Elena would want us to have a good time, you know she 
would. She loved parties. And she'd hate to see us sitting around and crying over her 
six months after she's gone." Caroline leaned forward, her normally feline green eyes 
earnest and compelling. There was no artifice in them now, none of Caroline's usual 


Page 2 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
nasty manipulation. Bonnie could tell she really meant it. 

"I want us to be friends again the way we used to be," Caroline said. "We always 
used to celebrate our birthdays together, just the four of us, remember? And 
remember how the guys would always try to crash our parties? I wonder if they'll try 
this year." 

Bonnie felt control of the situation slipping away from her. This is a bad idea, this 
is a very bad idea, she thought. But Caroline was going on, looking dreamy and 
almost romantic as she talked about the good old days. Bonnie didn't have the heart 
to tell her that the good old days were as dead as disco. 

"But there aren't even four of us anymore. Three doesn't make much of a party," 
she protested feebly when she could get a word in. 

"I'm going to invite Sue Carson, too. Meredith gets along with her, doesn't she?" 

Bonnie had to admit Meredith did; everyone got along with Sue. But even so, 
Caroline had to understand that things couldn't be the way they had been before. 
You couldn't just substitute Sue Carson for Elena and say, There, everything is fixed 
now. 

But how do I explain that to Caroline? Bonnie thought. Suddenly she knew. 

"Let's invite Vickie Bennett," she said. 


Caroline stared. "Vickie Bennett? You must be joking. Invite that bizarre little drip 
who undressed in front of half the school? After everything that happened?" 

Caroline stared. "Vickie Bennett? You must be joking. Invite that bizarre little drip 
who undressed in front of half the school? After everything that happened?" 

For a moment Caroline looked helplessly frustrated. Bonnie thrust her chin out, 
put her hands on her hips, and waited. Finally Caroline sighed. 

"All right; you win. I'll invite her. But you have to take care of getting Meredith to 
my house Saturday night. And Bonnie-make sure she doesn't have any idea what's 
going on. I really want this to be a surprise." 

"Oh, it will be," Bonnie said grimly. She was unprepared for the sudden light in 
Caroline's face or the impulsive warmth of Caroline's hug. 

"I'm so glad you're seeing things my way," Caroline said. "And it'll be so good 
for us all to be together again." 

She doesn't understand a thing, Bonnie realized, dazed, as Caroline walked off. 
What do I have to do to explain to her? Sock her? 

And then: Oh, God, now I have to tell Meredith.

L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
But by the end of the day she decided that maybe Meredith didn't need to be told. 
Caroline wanted Meredith surprised; well, maybe Bonnie should deliver Meredith 
surprised. That way at least Meredith wouldn't have to worry about it beforehand. 
Yes, Bonnie concluded, it was probably kindest to not tell Meredith anything. 

And who knows, she wrote in her journal Friday night. Maybe I'm being too hard 
on Caroline. Maybe she's really sorry about all the things she did to us, like trying 
to humiliate Elena in front of the whole town and trying to get Stefan put away for 
murder. Maybe Caroline's matured since then and learned to think about 
somebody besides herself. Maybe we'll actually have a good time at her party. 

And maybe aliens will kidnap me before tomorrow afternoon, she thought as she 
closed the diary. She could only hope. 

The diary was an inexpensive drugstore blank book, with a pattern of tiny flowers 
on the cover. She'd only started keeping it since Elena had died, but she'd already 
become slightly addicted to it. It was the one place she could say anything she 
wanted without people looking shocked and saying, "Bonnie McCullough!" or "Oh, 
Bonnie." 

She was still thinking about Elena as she turned off the light and crawled under the 
covers. 

She was sitting on lush, manicured grass that spread as far as she could see in all 
directions. The sky was a flawless blue, the air was warm and scented. Birds were 
singing. 


"I'm so glad you could come," Elena said. 
"Oh-yes," said Bonnie. "Well, naturally, so am I. Of course." She looked 

around again, then hastily back at Elena. 

"More tea?" 

There was a teacup in Bonnie's hand, thin and fragile as eggshell. "Oh-sure. 

Thanks." 

Elena was wearing an eighteenth-century dress of gauzy white muslin, which clung 
to her, showing how slender she was. She poured the tea precisely, without spilling a 

drop. 

"Would you like a mouse?" 

"A what?" 

"I said, would you like a sandwich with your tea?" 

Page 4 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
"Oh. A sandwich. Yeah. Great." It was thinly sliced cucumber with mayonnaise 
on a dainty square of white bread. Without the crust. 
The whole scene was as sparkly and beautiful as a picture by Seurat. Warm 

Springs, that's where we are. The old picnic place, Bonnie thought. But surely we've 

got more important things to discuss than tea. 
"Who does your hair these days?" she asked. Elena never had been able to do it 
herself. 


"Do you like it?" Elena put a hand up to the silky, pale gold mass piled at the back 


of her neck. 
"It's perfect," said Bonnie, sounding for all the world like her mother at a 
Daughters of the American Revolution dinner party. 


"Well, hair is important, you know," Elena said. Her eyes glowed a deeper blue 
than the sky, lapis lazuli blue. Bonnie touched her own springy red curls 
self-consciously. 
"Of course, blood is important too," Elena said. 


"Blood? Oh-yes, of course," said Bonnie, flustered. She had no idea what Elena 
was talking about, and she felt as if she were walking on a tightrope over alligators. 
"Yes, blood's important, all right," she agreed weakly. 


"Another sandwich?" 
"Thanks." It was cheese and tomato. Elena selected one for herself and bit into it 


delicately. Bonnie watched her, feeling uneasiness grow by the minute inside her, and 
then-
And then she saw the mud oozing out of the edges of the sandwich. 
"What-what's that?" Terror made her voice shrill. For the first time, the dream 

seemed like a dream, and she found that she couldn't move, could only gasp and 

stare. A thick glob of the brown stuff fell off Elena's sandwich onto the checkered 

tablecloth. It was mud, all right. "Elena... Elena, what-" 

tablecloth. It was mud, all right. "Elena... Elena, what-" 
The air was no longer warm and scented; it was hot and sickly sweet with the 
odor of rotting garbage. There were black pits in the green grass, which wasn't 
manicured after all but wild and overgrown. This wasn't Warm Springs. She was in 
the old graveyard; how could she not have realized that? Only these graves were 
fresh. 

Page 5 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
"Another mouse?" Elena said, and giggled obscenely. 

Bonnie looked down at the half-eaten sandwich she was holding and screamed. 
Dangling from one end was a ropy brown tail. She threw it as hard as she could 
against a headstone, where it hit with a wet slap. Then she stood, stomach heaving, 
scrubbing her fingers frantically against her jeans. 

"You can't leave yet. The company is just arriving." Elena's face was changing; 
she had already lost her hair, and her skin was turning gray and leathery. Things were 
moving in the plate of sandwiches and the freshly dug pits. Bonnie didn't want to see 
any of them; she thought she would go mad if she did. 

"You're not Elena!" she screamed, and ran. 

The wind blew her hair into her eyes and she couldn't see. Her pursuer was 
behind her; she could feel it right behind her. Get to the bridge, she thought, and then 
she ran into something. 

"I've been waiting for you," said the thing in Elena's dress, the gray skeletal thing 
with long, twisted teeth. "Listen to me, Bonnie." It held her with terrible strength. 

"You're not Elena! You're not Elena!" 

"Listen to me, Bonnie!" 

It was Elena's voice, Elena's real voice, not obscenely amused nor thick and ugly, 
but urgent. It came from somewhere behind Bonnie and it swept through the dream 
like a fresh, cold wind. "Bonnie, listen quickly-" 

Things were melting. The bony hands on Bonnie's arms, the crawling graveyard, 
the rancid hot air. For a moment Elena's voice was clear, but it was broken up like a 
bad long-dis-tance connection. 

"... He's twisting things, changing them. I'm not as strong as he is..." Bonnie 
missed some words. "... but this is important. You have to find... right now." Her 
voice was fading. 

"Elena, I can't hear you! Elena!" 

"... an easy spell, only two ingredients, the ones I told you already..." 

"Elena!" 

Bonnie was still shouting as she sat bolt upright in bed. 


Two 

"And that's all I remember," Bonnie concluded as she and Meredith walked down 

Page 6 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
Sunflower Street between the rows of tall Victorian houses. 

"But it was definitely Elena?" 

"Yes, and she was trying to tell me something at the end. But that's the part that 
wasn't clear, except that it was important, terribly important. What do you think?" 

"Mouse sandwiches and open graves?" Meredith arched an elegant eyebrow. "I 
think you're getting Stephen King mixed up with Lewis Carroll." 

Bonnie thought she was probably right. But the dream still bothered her; it had 
bothered her all day, enough to put her earlier worries out of her mind. Now, as she 
and Meredith approached Caroline's house, the old worries returned with a 
vengeance. 

She really should have told Meredith about this, she thought, casting an uneasy 
sideways glance at the taller girl. She shouldn't let Meredith just walk in there 
unprepared... 

Meredith looked up at the lighted windows of the Queen Anne House with a sigh. 
"Do you really need those earrings tonight?" 

"Yes, I do; yes, absolutely." Too late now. Might as well make the best of it. 
"You'll love them when you see them," she added, hearing the note of hopeful 
desperation in her own voice. 

Meredith paused and her keen dark eyes searched Bonnie's face curiously. Then 
she knocked on the door. "I just hope Caroline's not staying home tonight. We 
could end up stuck with her." 

"Caroline staying home on a Saturday night? Don't be ridiculous." Bonnie had 
been holding her breath too long; she was starting to feel lightheaded. Her tinkling 
laughter came out brittle and false. "What a concept," she continued somewhat 
hysterically as Meredith said, "I don't think anybody's home," and tried the knob. 
Possessed by some crazy impulse Bonnie added, "Fiddle-dee-dee." 

Hand on doorknob, Meredith stopped dead and turned to look at her. 

"Bonnie," she said quietly, "have you gone completely through the ozone?" 

"No." Deflated, Bonnie grabbed Meredith's arm and sought her eyes urgently. 
The door was opening on its own. "Oh, God, Meredith, please don't kill me..." 

"Surprise!" shouted three voices. 

"Smile," Bonnie hissed, shoving the suddenly resistant body of her friend through 
the door and into the bright room full of noise and showers of foil confetti. She 
beamed wildly herself and spoke through clenched teeth. "Kill me later-I deserve it 
-but for now just smile."

There were balloons, the expensive Mylar kind, and a cluster of presents on the 
coffee table. There was even a flower arrangement, although Bonnie noticed the 
orchids in it matched Caroline's pale green scarf exactly. It was a Hermes silk with a 
design of vines and leaves. She'll end up wearing one of those orchids in her hair, I'll 
bet, Bonnie thought.

"Nothing I can't break with an iron crowbar," Meredith replied. But she smiled 
back with wry warmth and Bonnie relaxed. Sue had been a Homecoming Princess 
on Elena's court, along with Bonnie, Meredith, and Caroline. She was the only girl at 
school besides Bonnie and Meredith who'd stood by Elena when everyone else had 
turned against her. At Elena's funeral she'd said that Elena would always be the real 
queen of Robert E. Lee, and she'd given up her own nomination for Snow Queen in 
Elena's memory. Nobody could hate Sue. The worst was over now, Bonnie thought. 

"I want to get a picture of us all on the couch," Caroline said, positioning them 
behind the flower arrangement. "Vickie, take it, will you?" 

Vickie Bennett had been standing by quietly, unnoticed. Now she said, "Oh, 
sure," and nervously flicked long, light brown hair out of her eyes as she picked up 
the camera. 

Just like she's some kind of servant, Bonnie thought, and then the flashbulb 
blinded her. 

As the Polaroid developed and Sue and Caroline laughed and talked around 
Meredith's dry politeness, Bonnie noticed something else. It was a good picture; 
Caroline looked stunning as ever with her auburn hair gleaming and the pale green 
orchids in front of her. And there was Meredith, looking resigned and ironic and 
darkly beautiful without even trying, and there she was herself, a head shorter than 
the others, with her red curls tousled and a sheepish expression on her face. But the 
strange thing was the figure beside her on the couch. It was Sue, of course it was 
Sue, but for a moment the blond hair and blue eyes seemed to belong to someone 
else. Someone looking at her urgently, on the verge of saying something important. 
Bonnie frowned at the photo, blinking rapidly. The image swam in front of her, and a 
chilling uneasiness ran up her spine. 

No, it was just Sue in the picture. She must've gone crazy for a minute, or else she 
was letting Caroline's desire for them "all to be together again" affect her. 

"I'll take the next one," she said, springing up. "Sit down, Vickie, and lean in. No, 
farther, farther-there!" All of Vickie's movements were quick and light and nervous. 
When the flashbulb went off, she started like a scared animal ready to bolt. 

Caroline scarcely glanced at this picture, getting up and heading for the kitchen 
instead. "Guess what we're having instead of cake?" she said. "I'm making my own 

Page 8 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
version of Death by Chocolate. Come on, you've got to help me melt the fudge." 
Sue followed her, and after an uncertain pause, so did Vickie. 


The last traces of Meredith's pleasant expression evaporated and she turned to 
Bonnie. "You should have told me." 

The last traces of Meredith's pleasant expression evaporated and she turned to 
Bonnie. "You should have told me." 

"And that makes it all worthwhile?" 

"Well, it helps," Bonnie said, with an air of being reasonable. "And really, it 
probably won't be so bad. Caroline's actually trying to be nice, and it's good for 
Vickie to get out of the house for once..." 

"It doesn't look like it's good for her," Meredith said bluntly. "It looks like she's 
going to have a heart attack." 

"Well, she's probably just nervous." In Bonnie's opinion, Vickie had good reason 
to be nervous. She'd spent most of the previous fall in a trance, being slowly driven 
out of her mind by a power she didn't understand. Nobody had expected her to 
come out of it as well as she had. 

Meredith was still looking bleak. "At least," Bonnie said consolingly, "it isn't your 
real birthday." 

Meredith picked up the camera and turned it over and over. Still looking down at 
her hands, she said, "But it is." 

"What?" Bonnie stared and then said louder, "What did you say?" 

"I said, it is my real birthday. Caroline's mom must have told her; she and my 
mom used to be friends a long time ago." 

"Meredith, what are you talking about? Your birthday was last week, May 30." 

"No, it wasn't. It's today, June 6. It's true; it's on my driver's license and 
everything. My parents started celebrating it a week early because June 6 was too 
upsetting for them. It was the day my grandfather was attacked and went crazy." As 
Bonnie gasped, unable to speak, she added calmly, "He tried to kill my grandmother, 
you know. He tried to kill me, too." Meredith put the camera down carefully in the 
exact center of the coffee table. "We really should go in the kitchen," she said 
quietly. "I smell chocolate." 

Bonnie was still paralyzed, but her mind was beginning to work again. Vaguely, 
she remembered Meredith speaking about this before, but she hadn't told her the full 
truth then. And she hadn't said when it had happened. 

"Attacked-you mean like Vickie was attacked," Bonnie got out. She couldn't say 
the word vampire, but she knew Meredith understood. 

Page 9 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
"Like Vickie was attacked," Meredith confirmed. "Come on," she added, even 
more quietly. "They're waiting for us. I didn't mean to upset you." 

Meredith doesn't want me to be upset, so I won't be upset, Bonnie thought, 


pouring hot fudge over the chocolate cake and chocolate ice cream. Even though 
we've been friends since first grade and she never told me this secret before.

we've been friends since first grade and she never told me this secret before. 

Then Bonnie shook her head determinedly. She couldn't think about this right 
now; she had a party to think about. And I'll make sure it's a good party and we all 
get along somehow, she thought. 

Strangely, it wasn't even that hard. Meredith and Vickie didn't talk much at first, 
but Bonnie went out of her way to be nice to Vickie, and even Meredith couldn't 
resist the pile of brightly wrapped presents on the coffee table. By the time she'd 
opened the last one they were all talking and laughing. The mood of truce and 
toleration continued as they moved up into Caroline's bedroom to examine her 
clothes and CDs and photo albums. As it got near midnight they flopped on sleeping 
bags, still talking. 

"What's going on with Alaric these days?" Sue asked Meredith. 

Alaric Saltzman was Meredith's boyfriend-sort of. He was a graduate student 
from Duke University who'd majored in parapsychology and had been called to 
Fell's Church last year when the vampire attacks began. Though he'd started out an 
enemy, he'd ended up an ally-and a friend. 

"He's in Russia," Meredith said. "Perestroika, you know? He's over there finding 
out what they were doing with psychics during the Cold War." 

"What are you going to tell him when he gets back?" asked Caroline. 

It was a question Bonnie would have liked to ask Meredith herself. Because Alaric 
was almost four years older, Meredith had told him to wait until after she graduated 
to talk about their future. But now Meredith was eighteen-today, Bonnie reminded 
herself-and graduation was in two weeks. What was going to happen after that? 

"I haven't decided," Meredith said. "Alaric wants me to go to Duke, and I've been 
accepted there, but I'm not sure. I have to think." 

Bonnie was just as glad. She wanted Meredith to go to Boone Junior College with 

her, not go off and get married, or even engaged. It was stupid to decide on one 
guy so young. Bonnie herself was notorious for playing the field, going from boy to 
boy as she pleased. She got crushes easily, and got over them just as easily.

"I haven't seen the guy so far worth remaining faithful to," she said now. 

Everyone looked at her quickly. Sue's chin was resting on her fists as she asked, 
"Not even Stefan?" 

Bonnie should have known. With the only light the dim bedside lamp and the only 
sound the rustle of new leaves on the weeping willows outside, it was inevitable that 
the conversation would turn to Stefan-and to Elena. 


Stefan Salvatore and Elena Gilbert were already a sort of legend in the town, like 
Romeo and Juliet. When Stefan had first come to Fell's Church, every girl had 
wanted him. And Elena, the most beautiful, most popular, most unapproachable girl 
at school, had wanted him too. It was only after she'd gotten him that she realized 
the danger. Stefan wasn't what he seemed-he had a secret far darker than anyone 
could have guessed. And he had a brother, Damon, even more mysterious and 
dangerous than himself. Elena had been caught between the two brothers, loving 
Stefan but drawn irresistibly to Damon's wildness. In the end she had died to save 
them both, and to redeem their love.

"I still can't believe she's gone," Sue said quietly, shaking her head and shutting 
her eyes. "She was so much more alive than other people." 

"Her flame burned brighter," said Meredith, gazing at the patterns the 
rose-and-gold lamp made on the ceiling. Her voice was soft but intense, and it 
seemed to Bonnie that those words described Elena better than anything she'd ever 
heard. 

"There were times when I hated her, but I could never ignore her," Caroline 
admitted, her green eyes narrowed in memory. "She wasn't a person you could 
ignore." 

"One thing I learned from her death," Sue said, "is that it could happen to any of 
us. You can't waste any of life because you never know how long you've got." 

"It could be sixty years or sixty minutes," Vickie agreed in a low voice. "Any of 
us could die tonight." 

Bonnie wriggled, disturbed. But before she could say anything, Sue repeated, "I 
still can't believe she's really gone. Sometimes I feel as if she's somewhere near."

L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
"Oh, so do I," said Bonnie, distracted. An image of Warm Springs flashed 
through her mind, and for a moment it seemed more vivid than Caroline's dim room. 
"Last night I dreamed about her, and I had the feeling it really was her and that she 
was trying to tell me something. I still have that feeling," she said to Meredith. 


The others gazed at her silently. Once, they would all have laughed if Bonnie 
hinted at any-thing supernatural, but not now. Her psychic powers were undisputed, 
awesome, and a little scary. 


"Do you really?" breathed Vickie. 


"What do you think she was trying to say?" asked Sue. 


"I don't know. At the end she was trying so hard to stay in contact with me, but 
she couldn't." 


There was another silence. At last Sue said hesitantly, with the faintest catch in her 
voice, "Do you think... do you think you could contact her?" 


. 
It was what they'd all been wondering. Bonnie looked toward Meredith. Earlier, 
Meredith had dismissed the dream, but now she met Bonnie's eyes seriously. 


It was what they'd all been wondering. Bonnie looked toward Meredith. Earlier, 
Meredith had dismissed the dream, but now she met Bonnie's eyes seriously. 


"Is that the only way to communicate with dead people? What about a Ouija 
board or something?" Sue asked. 


"My parents have a Ouija board," Caroline said a little too loudly. Suddenly the 
hushed, low-key mood was broken and an indefinable tension filled the air. Everyone 
sat up straighter and looked at each other with speculation. Even Vickie looked 
intrigued on top of her scaredness. 


"Would it work?" Meredith said to Bonnie. 


"Should we?" Sue wondered aloud. 


"Do we dare? That's really the question," Meredith said. Once again Bonnie found 
everyone looking at her. She hesitated a final instant, and then shrugged. Excitement 
was stirring in her stomach. 


"Why not?" she said. "What have we got to lose?" 


Caroline turned to Vickie. "Vickie, there's a closet at the bottom of the stairs. The 
Ouija board should be inside, on the top shelf with a bunch of other games." 


She didn't even say, "Please, will you get it?" Bonnie frowned and opened her 
mouth, but Vickie was already out the door. 


"You could be a little more gracious," Bonnie told Caroline. "What is this, your 


2 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
impression of Cinderella's evil stepmother?" 

"Oh, come on, Bonnie," Caroline said impatiently. "She's lucky just to be invited. 
She knows that." 

"And here I thought she was just overcome by our collective splendor," Meredith 
said dryly. 

"And besides-" Bonnie started when she was interrupted. The noise was thin 
and shrill and it fell off weakly at the end, but there was no mistaking it. It was a 
scream. It was followed by dead silence and then suddenly peal after peal of piercing 
shrieks. 

For an instant the girls in the bedroom stood transfixed. Then they were all 
running out into the hallway and down the stairs. 

"Vickie!" Meredith, with her long legs, reached the bottom first. Vickie was 
standing in front of the closet, arms outstretched as if to protect her face. She 
clutched at Meredith, still screaming. 

"Vickie, what is it?" Caroline demanded, sounding more angry than afraid. There 
were game boxes scattered across the floor and Monopoly markers and Trivial 
Pursuit cards strewn everywhere. "What are you yelling about?" 


"It grabbed me! I was reaching up to the top shelf and something grabbed me 
around the waist!" 

"It grabbed me! I was reaching up to the top shelf and something grabbed me 
around the waist!" 

"No! From inside the closet." 

Startled, Bonnie looked inside the open closet. Winter coats hung in an 
impenetrable layer, some of them reaching the floor. Gently disengaging herself from 
Vickie, Meredith picked up an umbrella and began poking the coats. 

"Oh, don't-" Bonnie began involuntarily, but the umbrella encountered only the 
resistance of cloth. Meredith used it to push the coats aside and reveal the bare 
cedarwood of the closet wall. 

"You see? Nobody there," she said lightly. "But you know what is there are these 
coat sleeves. If you leaned in far enough between them, I'll bet it could feel like 
somebody's arms closing around you." 

Vickie stepped forward, touched a dangling sleeve, then looked up at the shelf. 
She put her face in her hands, long silky hair falling forward to screen it. For an 
awful moment Bonnie thought she was crying, then she heard the giggles. 

"Oh, God! I really thought-oh, I'm so stupid! I'll clean it up," Vickie said.

L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
"Later," said Meredith firmly. "Let's go in the living room." 
Bonnie threw one last look at the closet as they went. 
When they were all gathered around the coffee table, with several lights turned off 


for effect, Bonnie put her fingers lightly on the small plastic planchette. She'd never 
actually used a Ouija board, but she knew how it was done. The planchette moved 
to point at letters and spell out a message-if the spirits were willing to talk, that is. 

"We all have to be touching it," she said, and then watched as the others obeyed. 
Meredith's fingers were long and slender, Sue's slim and tapering with oval nails. 
Caroline's nails were painted burnished copper. Vickie's were bitten. 

"Now we close our eyes and concentrate," Bonnie said softly. There were little 
hisses of anticipation as the girls obeyed; the atmosphere was getting to all of them. 

"Think of Elena. Picture her. If she's out there, we want to draw her here." 
The big room was silent. In the dark behind her closed lids Bonnie saw pale gold 
hair and eyes like lapis lazuli. 


"Come on, Elena," she whispered. "Talk to me." 
The planchette began to move. 
None of them could be guiding it; they were all applying pressure from different 


points. Nevertheless, the little triangle of plastic was sliding smoothly, confidently. 
Bonnie kept her eyes shut until it stopped and then looked. The planchette was 
pointing to the word Yes. 

Vickie gave something like a soft sob. 
. 
Bonnie looked at the others. Caroline was breathing fast, green eyes narrowed. 


Sue, the only one of all of them, still had her eyes resolutely closed. Meredith looked 
pale.

Sue, the only one of all of them, still had her eyes resolutely closed. Meredith looked 
pale. 
"Keep concentrating," Bonnie told them. She felt unready and a little stupid 
addressing the empty air directly. But she was the expert; she had to do it. 
"Is that you, Elena?" she said. 


The planchette made a little circle and returned to Yes. 
Suddenly Bonnie's heart was beating so hard she was afraid it would shake her 
fingers. The plastic underneath her fingertips felt different, electrified almost, as if

L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
some supernatural energy was flowing through it. She no longer felt stupid. Tears 
came to her eyes, and she could see that Meredith's eyes were glistening too. 
Meredith nodded at her. 

"How can we be sure?" Caroline was saying, loudly, suspiciously. Caroline 
doesn't feel it, Bonnie realized; she doesn't sense anything I do. Psychically 
speaking, she's a dud. 

The planchette was moving again, touching letters now, so quickly that Meredith 

barely had time to spell out the message. Even without punctuation it was clear. 
CAROLINE DONT BE A JERK, it said. YOURE LUCKY IM TALKING TO 
YOU AT ALL 

"That's Elena, all right," Meredith said dryly. 
"It sounds like her, but-" 
"Oh, shut up, Caroline," Bonnie said. "Elena, I'm just so glad..." Her throat 


locked up and she tried again. 


BONNIE THERES NO TIME STOP SNIVELING AND GET DOWN TO 
BUSINESS 
And that was Elena too. Bonnie sniffed and went on. "I had a dream about you 

last night." 
TEA 
"Yes." Bonnie's heart was thudding faster than ever. "I wanted to talk to you, but 


things got weird and then we kept losing contact-" 
BONNIE DONT TRANCE NO TRANCE NO TRANCE 
"All right." That answered her question, and she was relieved to hear it. 
CORRUPTING INFLUENCES DISTORTING OUR COMMUNICATION 


THERE ARE BAD THINGS VERY BAD THINGS OUT HERE 
"Like what?" Bonnie leaned closer to the board. "Like what?" 
NO TIME! 
. 


The planchette seemed to add the exclamation point. It was jerking violently from 


letter to letter as if Elena could barely contain her impatience.

"Danger?" Vickie repeated, looking as if she might jump off the chair and run.

WAIT LISTEN FIRST THE WHOLE TOWN IS IN DANGER 

"What do we do?" said Meredith instantly. 

YOU NEED HELP HES OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE UNBELIEVABLY 
STRONG NOW LISTEN AND FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS YOU HAVE TO DO 
A SUMMONING SPELL AND THE FIRST INGREDIENT IS H-

Without warning, the planchette jerked away from the letters and flew around the 
board wildly. It pointed at the stylized picture of the moon, then at the sun, then at 
the words Parker Brothers, Inc. 

"Elena!" 

The planchette bobbed back to the letters. 

ANOTHER MOUSE ANOTHER MOUSE ANOTHER MOUSE 

"What's happening?" Sue cried, eyes wide open now. 

Bonnie was frightened. The planchette was pulsing with energy, a dark and ugly 
energy like boiling black tar that stung her fingers. But she could also feel the 
quivering silver thread that was Elena's presence fighting it. "Don't let go!" she cried 
desperately. "Don't take your hands off it!" 

MOUSMUDKILLYOU, the board reeled off. BLOODBLOODBLOOD. And 
then... BONNIE GET OUT RUN HES HERE RUN RUN RU-

The planchette jerked furiously, whipping out from under Bonnie's fingers and 
beyond her reach, flying across the board and through the air as if someone had 
thrown it. Vickie screamed. Meredith started to her feet. 

And then all the lights went out, plunging the house into darkness. 


Three 

Vickie's screams went out of control. Bonnie could feel panic rising in her chest. 

"Vickie, stop it! Come on; we've got to get out of here!" Meredith was shouting 
to be heard. "It's your house, Caroline. Everybody grab hands and you lead us to 
the front door." 

"Okay," Caroline said. She didn't sound as frightened as everybody else. That 
was the advantage to having no imagination, Bonnie thought. You couldn't picture 
the terrible things that were going to happen to you. 

She felt better with Meredith's narrow, cold hand grasping hers. She fumbled on 
the other side and caught Caroline's, feeling the hardness of long fingernails.

L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
She could see nothing. Her eyes should be adjusting to the dark by now, but she 
couldn't make out even a glimmer of light or shadow as Caroline started leading 
them. There was no light coming through the windows from the street; the power 
seemed to be out everywhere. Caroline cursed, running into some piece of furniture, 
and Bonnie stumbled against her. 

Vickie was whimpering softly from the back of the line. "Hang on," whispered 
Sue. "Hang on, Vickie, we'll make it." 

They made slow, shuffling progress in the dark. Then Bonnie felt tile under her 
feet. "This is the front hall," Caroline said. "Stay here a minute while I find the door." 
Her fingers slipped out of Bonnie's. 

"Caroline! Don't let go-where are you? Caroline, give me your hand!" Bonnie 
cried, groping frantically like a blind person. 

Out of the darkness something large and moist closed around her fingers. It was a 
hand. It wasn't Caroline's. 

Bonnie screamed. 

Vickie immediately picked it up, shrieking wildly. The hot, moist hand was 
dragging Bonnie forward. She kicked out, struggling, but it made no difference. 
Then she felt Meredith's arms around her waist, both arms, wrenching her back. Her 
hand came free of the big one. 

And then she was turning and running, just running, only dimly aware that 
Meredith was be-side her. She wasn't at all aware that she was still screaming until 
she slammed into a large armchair that stopped her progress, and she heard herself. 

"Hush! Bonnie, hush, stop!" Meredith was shaking her. They had slid down the 
back of the chair to the floor. 

"Something had me! Something grabbed me, Meredith!" 

"I know. Be quiet! It's still around," Meredith said. Bonnie jammed her face into 
Meredith's shoulder to keep from screaming again. What if it was here in the room 
with them? 


Seconds crawled past, and the silence pooled around them. No matter how 
Bonnie strained her ears, she could hear no sound except their own breathing and the 
dull thudding of her heart.

Bonnie strained her ears, she could hear no sound except their own breathing and the 
dull thudding of her heart. 

Bonnie started to nod miserably, then abruptly lifted her head. "Where's Vickie?" 
she whispered hoarsely.

L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
"I don't know. I had to let go of her hand to pull you away from that thing. Let's 
move." 
Bonnie held her back. "But why isn't she screaming?" 
A shudder went through Meredith. "I don't know." 
"Oh, God. Oh, God. We can't leave her, Meredith." 


"We have to." 
"We can't. Meredith, I made Caroline invite her. She wouldn't be here except for 
me. We have to get her out." 


There was a pause, and then Meredith hissed, "All right! But you pick the 


strangest times to turn noble, Bonnie." 
A door slammed, causing both of them to jump. Then there was a crashing, like 
feet on stairs, Bonnie thought. And briefly, a voice was raised. 


"Vickie, where are you? Don't-Vickie, no! No!" 
"That was Sue," gasped Bonnie, jumping up. "From upstairs!" 
"Why don't we have a flashlight?" Meredith was raging. 
Bonnie knew what she meant. It was too dark to go running blindly around this 


house; it was too frightening. There was a primitive panic hammering in her brain. 


She needed light, any light. 
She couldn't go fumbling into that darkness again, exposed on all sides. She 
couldn't do it. 


Nevertheless, she took one shaky step away from the chair. 


"Come on," she gasped, and Meredith came with her, step by step, into the 
blackness. 
Bonnie kept expecting that moist, hot hand to reach out and grab her again. Every 


inch of her skin tingled in anticipation of its touch, and especially her own hand, 
which she had outstretched to feel her way. 


Then she made the mistake of remembering the dream. 
Instantly, the sickly sweet smell of garbage overwhelmed her. She imagined things 
crawling out of the ground and then remembered Elena's face, gray and hairless, with 
lips shriveled back from grinning teeth. If that thing grabbed hold of her... 


. 
I can't go any farther; I can't, I can't, she thought. I'm sorry for Vickie, but I can't

L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
go on. Please, just let me stop here. 

I can't go any farther; I can't, I can't, she thought. I'm sorry for Vickie, but I can't 
go on. Please, just let me stop here. 

It was a whole series of sounds, actually, but they all came so close together that 
they blended into one terrible swell of noise. First there was screaming, Sue's voice 
screaming, "Vickie! Vickie! No!" Then a resonant crash, the sound of glass 
shattering, as if a hundred windows were breaking at once. And over that a sustained 
scream, on a note of pure, exquisite terror. 

Then it all stopped. 

"What was it? What happened, Meredith?" 

"Something bad." Meredith's voice was taut and choked. "Something very bad. 
Bonnie, let go. I'm going to see." 

"Not alone, you're not," Bonnie said fiercely. 

They found the staircase and made their way up it. When they reached the 
landing, Bonnie could hear a strange and oddly sickening sound, the tinkle of glass 
shards falling. 

And then the lights went on. 

It was too sudden; Bonnie screamed involuntarily. Turning to Meredith she almost 
screamed again. Meredith's dark hair was disheveled and her cheekbones looked too 
sharp; her face was pale and hollow with fear. 

Tinkle, tinkle. 

It was worse with the lights on. Meredith was walking toward the last door down 
the hall, where the noise was coming from. Bonnie followed, but she knew suddenly, 
with all her heart, that she didn't want to see inside that room. 

Meredith pulled the door open. She froze for a minute in the doorway and then 
lunged quickly inside. Bonnie started for the door. 

"Oh, my God, don't come any farther!" 

Bonnie didn't even pause. She plunged into the doorway and then pulled up short. 
At first glance it looked as if the whole side of the house was gone. The French 
windows that connected the master bedroom to the balcony seemed to have 
exploded outward, the wood splintered, the glass shattered. Little pieces of glass 
were hanging precariously here and there from the remnants of the wood frame. 
They tinkled as they fell. 

Diaphanous white curtains billowed in and out of the gaping hole in the house. In 
front of them, in silhouette, Bonnie could see Vickie. She was standing with her 
hands at her sides, as motionless as a block of stone.

L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
"Vickie, are you okay?" Bonnie was so relieved to see her alive that it was painful. 
"Vickie?" 


. 
Vickie didn't turn, didn't answer. Bonnie maneuvered around her cautiously, 
looking into her face. Vickie was staring straight ahead, her pupils pinpoints. She 
was sucking in little whistling breaths, chest heaving. 


Vickie didn't turn, didn't answer. Bonnie maneuvered around her cautiously, 
looking into her face. Vickie was staring straight ahead, her pupils pinpoints. She 
was sucking in little whistling breaths, chest heaving. 


Shuddering, Bonnie reeled away. Meredith was on the balcony. She turned as 
Bonnie reached the curtains and tried to block the way. 


"Don't look. Don't look down there," she said. 


Down where? Suddenly Bonnie understood. She shoved past Meredith, who 
caught her arm to stop her on the edge of a dizzying drop. The balcony railing had 
been blasted out like the French windows and Bonnie could see straight down to the 
lighted yard below. On the ground there was a twisted figure like a broken doll, limbs 
askew, neck bent at a grotesque angle, blond hair fanned on the dark soil of the 
garden. It was Sue Carson. 


And throughout all the confusion that raged afterward, two thoughts kept vying 
for dominance in Bonnie's mind. One was that Caroline would never have her 
foursome now. And the other was that it wasn't fair for this to happen on Meredith's 
birthday. It just wasn't fair. 


"I'm sorry, Meredith. I don't think she's up to it right now." 


Bonnie heard her father's voice at the front door as she listlessly stirred sweetener 
into a cup of chamomile tea. She put the spoon down at once. What she wasn't up 
to was sitting in this kitchen one minute longer. She needed out. 


"I'll be right there, Dad." 


Meredith looked almost as bad as she had last night, face peaked, eyes 
shadowed. Her mouth was set in a tight line. 


"We'll just go out driving for a little while," Bonnie said to her father. "Maybe see 
some of the kids. After all, you're the one who said it isn't dangerous, right?" 


What could he say? Mr. McCullough looked down at his petite daughter, who 
stuck out the stubborn chin she'd inherited from him and met his gaze squarely. He 
lifted his hands. 


"It's almost four o'clock now. Be back before dark," he said. 


"They want it both ways," Bonnie said to Meredith on the way to Meredith's car. 


Page 20 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
Once inside, both girls immediately locked their doors. 

As Meredith put the car in gear she gave Bonnie a glance of grim understanding. 

"Your parents didn't believe you, either." 

"Oh, they believe everything I told them-except anything important. How can 
they be so stupid?" 

Meredith laughed shortly. "You've got to look at it from their point of view. They 


find one dead body without a mark on it except those caused by the fall. They find 
that the lights were off in the neighborhood because of a malfunction at Virginia 
Electric. They find us, hysterical, giving answers to their questions that must have 
seemed pretty weird. Who did it? Some monster with sweaty hands. How do we 
know? Our dead friend Elena told us through a Ouija board. Is it any wonder they 
have their doubts?"

have their doubts?" 

"They're forgetting already," Meredith replied softly. "You predicted it yourself. 
Life has gone back to normal, and everybody in Fell's Church feels safer that way. 
They all feel like they've woken up from a bad dream, and the last thing they want is 
to get sucked in again." 

Bonnie just shook her head. 

"And so it's easier to believe that a bunch of teenage girls got riled up playing with 
a Ouija board, and that when the lights went out they just freaked and ran. And one 
of them got so scared and confused she ran right out a window." 

There was a silence and then Meredith added, "I wish Alaric were here." 

Normally, Bonnie would have given her a dig in the ribs and answered, "So do I," 
in a lecherous voice. Alaric was one of the handsomest guys she'd ever seen, even if 
he was a doddering twenty-two years old. Now, she just gave Meredith's arm a 
disconsolate squeeze. "Can't you call him somehow?" 

"In Russia? I don't even know where in Russia he is now." 

Bonnie bit her lip. 

Then she sat up. Meredith was driving down Lee Street, and in the high school 
parking lot they could see a crowd. 

Page 21 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
She and Meredith exchanged glances, and Meredith nodded. "We might as well," 
she said. "Let's see if they're any smarter than their parents." 


Bonnie could see startled faces turning as the car cruised slowly into the lot. 
When she and Meredith got out, people moved back, making a path for them to the 
center of the crowd. 


Caroline was there, clutching her elbows with her hands and shaking back her 
auburn hair distractedly. 


"We're not going to sleep in that house again until it's repaired," she was saying, 
shivering in her white sweater. "Daddy says we'll take an apartment in Heron until it's 
over." 


"What difference does that make? He can follow you to Heron, I'm sure," said 
Meredith. 


Caroline turned, but her green cat's eyes wouldn't quite meet Meredith's. "Who?" 
she said vaguely. 


. 
"Oh, Caroline, not you too!" Bonnie exploded. 


"Oh, Caroline, not you too!" Bonnie exploded. 


Her eyes came up and for an instant Bonnie saw how frightened she was. "I can't 
take any more." As if she had to prove her words that minute, she pushed her way 
through the crowd. 


"Let her go, Bonnie," Meredith said. "It's no use." 


"She's no use," said Bonnie furiously. If Caroline, who knew, was acting this way, 
what about the other kids? 


She saw the answer-in the faces around her. Everybody looked scared, as scared 
as if she and Meredith had brought some loathsome disease with them. As if she and 
Meredith were the problem. 


"I don't believe this," Bonnie muttered. 


"I don't believe it either," said Deanna Kennedy, a friend of Sue's. She was in the 
front of the crowd, and she didn't look as uneasy as the others. "I talked with Sue 
yesterday afternoon and she was so up, so happy. She can't be dead." Deanna 
began to sob. Her boyfriend put an arm around her, and several other girls began to 
cry. The guys in the crowd shifted, their faces rigid. 


Bonnie felt a little surge of hope. "And she's not going to be the only one dead," 
she added. "Elena told us that the whole town is in danger. Elena said..." Despite 
herself Bonnie heard her voice failing. She could see it in the way their eyes glazed 
up when she mentioned Elena's name. Meredith was right; they'd put everything that 
had happened last winter behind them. They didn't believe anymore. 


Page 22 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
"What's wrong with you all?" she said helplessly, wanting to hit something. "You 
don't really think Sue threw herself off that balcony!" 

"People are saying-" Deanna's boyfriend started and then shrugged defensively. 
"Well-you told the police Vickie Bennett was in the room, right? And now she's off 
her head again. And just a little bit earlier you'd heard Sue shouting, 'No, Vickie, 
no!'?" 

Bonnie felt as if the wind had been knocked out of her. "You think that Vickie-
oh, God, you're out of your mind! Listen to me. Something grabbed my hand in that 
house, and it wasn't Vickie. And Vickie had nothing to do with throwing Sue off that 
balcony." 

"She's hardly strong enough, for one thing," Meredith said pointedly. "She weighs 
about ninety-five pounds soaking wet." 

Somebody from the back of the crowd muttered about insane people having 
superhuman strength. "Vickie has a psychiatric record-" 

"Elena told us it was a guy!" Bonnie almost shouted, losing her battle with 
self-control. The faces tilted toward her were shuttered, unyielding. Then she saw 
one that made her chest loosen. "Matt! Tell them you believe us." 

Matt Honeycutt was standing on the fringe with his hands in his pockets and his 


blond head bowed. Now he looked up, and what Bonnie saw in his blue eyes made 
her draw in her breath. They weren't hard and shuttered like everyone else's, but they 
were full of a flat despair that was just as bad. He shrugged without taking his hands 
from his pockets.

Bonnie, for one of the first times in her life, was speechless. Matt had been upset 
ever since Elena died, but this... 

"He does believe it, though," Meredith was saying quickly, capitalizing on the 
moment. "Now what have we got to do to convince the rest of you?" 

"Channel Elvis for us, maybe," said a voice that immediately set Bonnie's blood 
boiling. Tyler. Tyler Smallwood. Grinning like an ape in his overexpensive Perry Ellis 
sweater, showing a mouthful of strong white teeth. 

"It's not as good as psychic e-mail from a dead Homecoming Queen, but it's a 
start," Tyler added. 

Matt always said that grin was asking for a punch in the nose. But Matt, the only 

Page 23 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
guy in the crowd with close to Tyler's physique, was staring dully at the ground. 

"Shut up, Tyler! You don't know what happened in that house," Bonnie said. 

"Well, neither do you, apparently. Maybe if you hadn't been hiding in the living 
room, you'd have seen what happened. Then somebody might believe you." 

Bonnie's retort died on her tongue. She stared at Tyler, opened her mouth, and 
then closed it. Tyler waited. When she didn't speak, he showed his teeth again. 

"For my money, Vickie did it," he said, winking at Dick Carter, Vickie's 
ex-boyfriend. "She's a strong little babe, right, Dick? She could have done it." He 
turned and added deliberately over his shoulder, "Or else that Salvatore guy is back 
in town." 

"You creep!" shouted Bonnie. Even Meredith cried out in frustration. Because of 
course at the very mention of Stefan pandemonium ensued, as Tyler must have 
known it would. Everyone was turning to the person next to them and exclaiming in 
alarm, horror, excitement. It was primarily the girls who were excited. 

Effectively, it put an end to the gathering. People had been edging away 
surreptitiously before, and now they broke up into twos and threes, arguing and 
hastening off. 

Bonnie gazed after them angrily. 

"Supposing they did believe you. What did you want them to do, anyway?" Matt 
said. She hadn't noticed him beside her. 

"I don't know. Something besides just standing around waiting to be picked off." 
She tried to look him in the face. "Matt, are you all right?" 

"I don't know. Are you?" 


Bonnie thought. "No. I mean, in one way I'm surprised I'm doing as well as I am, 
because when Elena died, I just couldn't deal. At all. But then I wasn't as close to 
Sue, and besides... I don't know!" She wanted to hit something again. "It's just all 
too much!" 

Bonnie thought. "No. I mean, in one way I'm surprised I'm doing as well as I am, 
because when Elena died, I just couldn't deal. At all. But then I wasn't as close to 
Sue, and besides... I don't know!" She wanted to hit something again. "It's just all 
too much!" 

"Yes, I'm mad." Suddenly Bonnie understood the feelings she'd been having all 
day. "Killing Sue wasn't just wrong, it was evil. Truly evil. And whoever did it isn't 
going to get away with it. That would be-if the world is like that, a place where that 
can happen and go unpunished... if that's the truth..." She found she didn't have a 
way to finish. 

Page 24 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
"Then what? You don't want to live here anymore? What if the world is like that?" 


His eyes were so lost, so bitter. Bonnie was shaken. But she said staunchly, "I 
won't let it be that way. And you won't either." 


He simply looked at her as if she were a kid insisting there was so a Santa Claus. 


Meredith spoke up. "If we expect other people to take us seriously, we'd better 
take ourselves seriously. Elena did communicate with us. She wanted us to do 
something. Now if we really believe that, we'd better figure out what it is." 


Matt's face had flexed at the mention of Elena. You poor guy, you're still as much 
in love with her as ever, thought Bonnie. I wonder if anything could make you forget 
her? She said, "Are you going to help us, Matt?" 


"I'll help," Matt said quietly. "But I still don't know what it is you're doing." 


"We're going to stop that murdering creep before he kills anybody else," said 
Bonnie. It was the first time she'd fully realized herself that this was what she meant 
to do. 


"Alone? Because you are alone, you know." 


"We are alone," Meredith corrected. "But that's what Elena was trying to tell us. 
She said we had to do a summoning spell to call for help." 


"An easy spell with only two ingredients," Bonnie remembered from her dream. 
She was getting excited. "And she said she'd already told me the ingredients-but 
she hadn't." 


"Last night she said there were corrupting influences distorting her 
communication," Meredith said. "Now to me that sounds like what was happening in 
the dream. Do you think it really was Elena you were drinking tea with?" 


"Yes," Bonnie said positively. "I mean, I know we weren't really having a mad tea 
party at Warm Springs, but I think Elena was sending that message into my brain. 
And then partway through something else took over and pushed her out. But she 
fought, and for a minute at the end she got back control." 


"Okay. Then that means we have to concentrate on the beginning of the dream, 
when it was still Elena communicating with you. But if what she was saying was 
already being distorted by other influences, then maybe it came out weird. Maybe it 


. 
wasn't something she actually said, maybe it was something she did..." 


wasn't something she actually said, maybe it was something she did..." 


"What?" 


"Hair! I asked her who did hers, and we talked about it, and she said, 'Hair is very 


Page 25 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
important.' And Meredith-when she was trying to tell us the ingredients last night, 
the first letter of one of them was H!" 

"That's it!" Meredith's dark eyes were flashing. "Now we just have to think of the 
other one." 

"But I know that too!" Bonnie's laughter bubbled up exuberantly. "She told me 
right after we talked about hair, and I thought she was just being strange. She said, 
'Blood is important too.' " 

Meredith shut her eyes in realization. "And last night, the Ouija board said 
'Bloodblood-blood.' I thought it was the other thing threatening us, but it wasn't," 
she said. She opened her eyes. "Bonnie, do you think that's really it? Are those the 
ingredients, or do we have to start worrying about mud and sandwiches and mice 
and tea?" 

"Those are the ingredients," Bonnie said firmly. "They're the kind of ingredients 
that make sense for a summoning spell. I'm sure I can find a ritual to do with them in 
one of my Celtic magic books. We just have to figure out the person we're 
supposed to summon..." Something struck her, and her voice trailed off in dismay. 

"I was wondering when you'd notice," Matt said, speaking for the first time in a 
long while. "You don't know who it is, do you?" 


Four 

Meredith tilted an ironic glance at Matt. "Hmm," she said. "Now, who do you 
think Elena would call in time of trouble?" 

Bonnie's grin gave way to a twinge of guilt at Matt's expression. It wasn't fair to 
tease him about this. "Elena said that the killer is too strong for us and that's why we 
need help," she told Matt. "And I can think of only one person Elena knows who 
could fight off a psychic killer." 

Slowly, Matt nodded. Bonnie couldn't tell what he was feeling. He and Stefan had 
been best friends once, even after Elena had chosen Stefan over Matt. But that had 
been before Matt found out what Stefan was, and what kind of violence he was 
capable of. In his rage and grief over Elena's death Stefan had nearly killed Tyler 
Smallwood and five other guys. Could Matt really forget that? Could he even deal 
with Stefan coming back to Fell's Church? 

Matt's square-jawed face gave no sign now, and Meredith was talking again. "So 
all we need to do is let some blood and cut some hair. You won't miss a curl or two, 
will you, Bonnie?" 

Bonnie was so abstracted that she almost missed this. Then she shook her head. 
"No, no, no. It isn't our blood and hair we need. We need it from the person we 
want to summon." 

Page 26 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
"What? But that's ridiculous. If we had Stefan's blood and hair we wouldn't need 
to summon him, would we?" 


"I didn't think of that," Bonnie admitted. "Usually with a summoning spell you get 
the stuff beforehand and use it when you want to call a person back. What are we 
going to do, Meredith? It's impossible." 


Meredith's brows were drawn together. "Why would Elena ask it if it were 
impossible?" 


"Elena asked lots of impossible things," Bonnie said darkly. "Don't look like that, 
Matt; you know she did. She wasn't a saint." 


"Maybe, but this one isn't impossible," Matt said. "I can think of one place where 
Stefan's blood has got to be, and if we're lucky some of his hair, too. In the crypt." 


Bonnie flinched, but Meredith simply nodded. 


"Of course," she said. "While Stefan was tied up there, he must have bled all over 
the place. And in that kind of fight he might have lost some hair. If only everything 
down there has been left undisturbed..." 


"I don't think anybody's been down there since Elena died," Matt said. "The 
police investigated and then left it. But there's only one way to find out." 


I was wrong, Bonnie thought. I was worrying about whether Matt could deal with 
Stefan coming back, and here he is doing everything he can to help us summon him. 


. 
"Matt, I could kiss you!" she said. 


"Matt, I could kiss you!" she said. 


"All the girls say that," he replied calmly at last, with a shrug of mock resignation. 
It was as close as he'd gotten to lightheartedness all day. 


Meredith, however, was serious. "Let's go. We've got a lot to do, and the last 
thing we want is to get stuck in the crypt after dark." 


The crypt was beneath the ruined church that stood on a hill in the cemetery. It's 
only late afternoon, plenty of light left, Bonnie kept telling herself as they walked up 
the hill, but goose-flesh broke out on her arms anyway. The modern cemetery on 
one side was bad enough, but the old graveyard on the other side was downright 
spooky even in daylight. There were so many crumbling headstones tilting crazily in 
the overgrown grass, representing so many young men killed in the Civil War. You 
didn't have to be psychic to feel their presence. 


"Unquiet spirits," she muttered. 


"Hmm?" said Meredith as she stepped over the pile of rubble that was one wall of 
the ruined church. "Look, the lid of the tomb's still off. That's good news; I don't 


Page 27 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
think we would have been able to lift it." 

Bonnie's eyes lingered wistfully on the white marble statues carved on the 
displaced lid. Hon-oria Fell lay there with her husband, hands folded on her breast, 
looking as gentle and sad as ever. But Bonnie knew there would be no more help 
from that quarter. Honoria's duties as protector of the town she'd founded were 
done. 

Leaving Elena holding the bag, Bonnie thought grimly, looking down into the 
rectangular hole that led to the crypt. Iron rungs disappeared into darkness. 

Even with the help of Meredith's flashlight it was hard to climb down into that 
underground room. Inside, it was dank and silent, the walls faced with polished 
stone. Bonnie tried not to shiver. 

"Look," said Meredith quietly. 

Matt had the flashlight trained on the iron gate that separated the anteroom of the 
crypt from its main chamber. The stone below was stained black with blood in 
several places. Looking at the puddles and rivulets of dried gore made Bonnie feel 
dizzy. 

"We know Damon was hurt the worst," Meredith said, moving forward. She 
sounded calm, but Bonnie could hear the tight control in her voice. "So he must 
have been on this side where there's the most blood. Stefan said Elena was in the 
center. That means Stefan himself must have been... here." She bent down. 

"I'll do it," Matt said gruffly. "You hold the light." With a plastic picnic knife from 


Meredith's car he scraped at the encrusted stone. Bonnie swallowed, glad she'd had 
only tea for lunch. Blood was all right in the abstract, but when you were actually 
confronted with so much of it-especially when it was the blood of a friend who'd 
been tortured...

And then, thought Bonnie, she faked her own death to get Stefan and Damon to 
stop fighting over her. But it didn't work. They hated each other more than ever, and 
she hated both of them for that. She'd gone back to the vampire who made her, and 
over the years she'd turned as evil as he was. Until at last all she wanted to do was 
destroy the brothers she had once loved. She'd lured them both to Fell's Church to 
kill them, and this room was where she'd almost succeeded in doing it. Elena had 
died stopping her. 

"There," Matt said, and Bonnie blinked and came back to herself. Matt was 
standing with a paper napkin that now held flakes of Stefan's blood in its folds. 
"Now the hair," he said. 

Page 28 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
They swept the floor with their fingers, finding dust and bits of leaves and 
fragments of things Bonnie didn't want to identify. Among the detritus were long 
strands of pale gold hair. Elena's-or Katherine's, Bonnie thought. They had looked 
much alike. There were also shorter strands of dark hair, crisp with a slight wave. 
Stefan's. 


It was slow, finicky work sorting through it all and putting the right hairs in 
another napkin. 


Matt did most of it. When they were through, they were all tired and the light 
sifting down through the rectangular opening in the ceiling was dim blue. But 
Meredith smiled tigerishly. 


"We've got it," she said. "Tyler wants Stefan back; well, we'll give him Stefan 
back." 


And Bonnie, who had been only half paying attention to what she was doing, still 
lost in her own thoughts, froze. 


She'd been thinking about other things entirely, nothing to do with Tyler, but at 
the mention of his name something had winked on in her mind. Something she'd 
realized in the parking lot and then forgotten afterward in the heat of arguing. 
Meredith's words had triggered it and now it was suddenly all clear again. How had 
he known! she wondered, heart racing. 


"Bonnie? What's the matter?" 


"Meredith," she said softly, "did you tell the police specifically that we were in the 
living room when everything was going on upstairs with Sue?" 


. 
"No, I think I just said we were downstairs. Why?" 


"No, I think I just said we were downstairs. Why?" 


"Bonnie, if you're trying to suggest Tyler was the murderer, it just won't wash. 
He's not smart enough to organize a killing spree, for one thing," Meredith said. 


"But there's something else. Meredith, last year at the Junior Prom, Tyler touched 
me on my bare shoulder. I'll never forget it. His hand was big, and meaty, and hot, 
and damp." Bonnie shivered at the recollection. "Just like the hand that grabbed me 
last night." 


But Meredith was shaking her head, and even Matt looked unconvinced. 


"Elena's sure wasting her time asking us to bring back Stefan, then," he said. "I 
could take care of Tyler with a couple of right hooks." 


"Think about it, Bonnie," Meredith added. "Does Tyler have the psychic power 
to move a Ouija board or come into your dreams? Does he?" 


Page 29 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
He didn't. Psychically speaking, Tyler was as much a dud as Caroline. Bonnie 
couldn't deny it. But she couldn't deny her intuition, either. It didn't make sense, but 
she still felt Tyler had been in the house last night. 


"We'd better get moving," Meredith said. "It's dark, and your father's going to be 
furious." 


They were all silent on the ride home. Bonnie was still thinking about Tyler. Once 
at her house they smuggled the napkins upstairs and began looking through Bonnie's 
books on Druids and Celtic magic. Ever since she'd discovered that she was 
descended from the ancient race of magic workers, Bonnie had been interested in the 
Druids. And in one of the books she found a ritual for a summoning spell. 


"We need to buy candles," she said. "And pure water-better get some bottled," 
she said to Meredith. "And chalk to draw a circle on the floor, and something to 
make a small fire in. I can find those in the house. There's no hurry; the spell has to 
be done at midnight." 


Midnight was a long time coming. Meredith bought the necessary items at a 
grocery store and brought them back. They ate dinner with Bonnie's family, though 
no one had much of an appetite. By eleven o'clock Bonnie had the circle drawn on 
the hardwood floor of her bedroom and all the other ingredients on a low bench 
inside the circle. On the stroke of twelve she started. 


With Matt and Meredith watching, she made a small fire in an earthenware bowl. 
Three candles were burning behind the bowl; she stuck a pin halfway down the one 
in the center. Then she unfolded a napkin and carefully stirred the dried flakes of 
blood into a wineglass of water. It turned rusty pink. 


She opened the other napkin. Three pinches of dark hair went into the fire, 


. 
sizzling with a terrible smell. Then three drops of the stained water, hissing. 


sizzling with a terrible smell. Then three drops of the stained water, hissing. 


Swift on the heel thou comest, 
Thrice summoned by my spell, 
Thrice troubled by my burning. 
Come to me without delay. 


She read the words aloud slowly, three times. Then she sat back on her heels. 
The fire went on burning smokily. The candle flames danced. 


"And now what?" Matt said. 


"I don't know. It just says wait for the middle candle to burn down to the pin." 


"And what then?" 


Page 30 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
"I guess we'll find out when it happens." 

In Florence, it was dawn. 

Stefan watched the girl move down the stairway, one hand resting lightly on the 
banister to keep her balance. Her movements were slow and slightly dreamlike, as if 
she were floating. 


Suddenly, she swayed and clutched at the banister more tightly. Stefan moved 
quickly behind her and put a hand under her elbow. 


"Are you all right?" 


She looked up at him with the same dreaminess. She was very pretty. Her 
expensive clothes were the latest fashion and her stylishly disarrayed hair was blond. 
A tourist. He knew she was American before she spoke. 


"Yes... I think..." Her brown eyes were unfocused. 


"Do you have a way to get home? Where are you staying?" 


"On Via dei Conti, near the Medici chapel. I'm with the Gonzaga in Florence 
program." 


Damn! Not a tourist, then; a student. And that meant she'd be carrying this story 
back with her, telling her classmates about the handsome Italian guy she'd met last 
night. The one with night-dark eyes. The one who took her back to his exclusive 
place on Via Tornabuoni and wined her and dined her and then, in the moonlight, 
maybe, in his room or out in the enclosed courtyard, leaned close to look into her 
eyes and... 


Stefan's gaze slid away from the girl's throat with its two reddened puncture 
wounds. He'd seen marks like that so often-how could they still have the power to 
disturb him? But they did; they sickened him and set a slow burning in his gut. 


"What's your name?" 


"Rachael. With an a." She spelled it. 


. 
"All right, Rachael. Look at me. You will go back to your pensione and you won't 
remember anything about last night. You don't know where you went or who you 
saw. And you've never seen me before, either. Repeat." 


"All right, Rachael. Look at me. You will go back to your pensione and you won't 
remember anything about last night. You don't know where you went or who you 
saw. And you've never seen me before, either. Repeat." 


"Good. Do you have money to get back? Here." Stefan pulled a fistful of 
crumpled lire-mostly 50,000 and 100,000 notes-out of his pocket and led her 
outside. 


Page 31 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
When she was safely in a cab, he went back inside and made straight for Damon's 


bedroom. 
Damon was lounging near the window, peeling an orange, not even dressed yet. 
He looked up, annoyed, as Stefan entered. 


"It's customary to knock," he said. 


"Where'd you meet her?" said Stefan. And then, when Damon turned a blank 
stare on him, he added, "That girl. Rachael." 
"Was that her name? I don't think I bothered to ask. At Bar Gilli. Or perhaps it 


was Bar Mario. Why?" 
Stefan struggled to contain his anger. "That's not the only thing you didn't bother 


to do. You didn't bother to influence her to forget you, either. Do you want to get 
caught, Damon?" 
Damon's lips curved in a smile and he twisted off a curlicue of orange peel. "I am 

never caught, little brother," he said. 
"So what are you going to do when they come after you? When somebody 


realizes, 'My God, there's a bloodsucking monster on Via Tornabuoni'? Kill them 
all? Wait until they break down the front door and then melt away into darkness?" 
Damon met his gaze directly, challengingly, that faint smile still clinging about his 

lips. 
"Why not?" he said. 
"Damn you!" said Stefan. "Listen to me, Damon. This has got to stop." 
"I'm touched at your concern for my safety." 
"It isn't fair, Damon. To take an unwilling girl like that-" 
"Oh, she was willing, brother. She was very, very willing." 
"Did you tell her what you were going to do? Did you warn her about the 


consequences of exchanging blood with a vampire? The nightmares, the psychic 
visions? Was she willing for that?" Damon clearly wasn't going to reply, so he went 
on. "You know it's wrong." 

"As a matter of fact, I do." With that, Damon gave one of his sudden, unnerving 

. 
smiles, turning it on and off instantly. 
smiles, turning it on and off instantly. 


Page 32 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
Damon tossed away the orange. His tone was silky, persuasive. "Little brother, 
the world is full of what you call 'wrong,' " he said. "Why not relax and join the 
winning side? It's much more fun, I assure you." 


Stefan felt himself go hot with anger. "How can you even say that?" he flashed 
back. "Didn't you learn anything from Katherine? She chose 'the winning side.' " 


"Katherine died too quickly," said Damon. He was smiling again, but his eyes 
were cold. 


"And now all you can think about is revenge." Looking at his brother, Stefan felt a 
crushing weight settle on his own chest. "That and your own pleasure," he said. 


"What else is there? Pleasure is the only reality, little brother-pleasure and 
power. And you're a hunter by nature, just as much as I am," Damon said. He 
added, "I don't remember inviting you to come to Florence with me, anyway. Since 
you're not enjoying yourself, why don't you just leave?" 


The weight in Stefan's chest tightened suddenly, unbearably, but his gaze, locked 
with Damon's, did not waver. "You know why," he said quietly. And at last he had 
the satisfaction of seeing Damon's eyes drop. 


Stefan himself could hear Elena's words in his mind. She'd been dying then, and 
her voice had been weak, but he'd heard her clearly. You have to take care of each 
other. Stefan, will you promise? Promise to take care of each other? And he had 
promised, and he would keep his word. No matter what. 


"You know why I don't leave," he said again to Damon, who wouldn't look at 
him. "You can pretend you don't care. You can fool the whole world. But I know 
differently." It would have been kindest at this point to leave Damon alone, but 
Stefan wasn't in a kind mood. "You know that girl you picked up, Rachael?" he 
added. "The hair was all right, but her eyes were the wrong color. Elena's eyes were 
blue." 


With that he turned, meaning to leave Damon here to think it over-if Damon 
would do anything so constructive, of course. But he never made it to the door. 


"It's there!" said Meredith sharply, her eyes on the candle flame and the pin. 


Bonnie sucked in her breath. Something was opening in front of her like a silver 
thread, a silver tunnel of communication. She was rushing along it, with no way to 
stop herself or check her speed. Oh, God, she thought, when I reach the end and hit 
-


The flash in Stefan's head was soundless, lightless, and powerful as a 
thunderclap. At the same time he felt a violent, wrenching tug. An urge to follow-
something. This was not like Katherine's sly subliminal nudging to go somewhere; 


. 
this was a psychic shout. A command that could not be disobeyed. 
Inside the flash he sensed a presence, but he could scarcely believe who it was.

this was a psychic shout. A command that could not be disobeyed. 
Inside the flash he sensed a presence, but he could scarcely believe who it was. 
? 
Stefan! It's you! It worked! 
Bonnie, what have you done? 
Elena told me to. Honestly, Stefan, she did. We're in trouble and we need-
And that was it. The communication collapsed, caving in on itself, dwindling to a 


pinpoint. It was gone, and in its aftermath the room vibrated with Power. 
Stefan and his brother were left staring at each other. 


Bonnie let out a long breath she hadn't realized she'd been holding and opened her 
eyes, though she didn't remember closing them. She was lying on her back. Matt and 
Meredith were crouched over her, looking alarmed. 


"What happened? Did it work?" Meredith demanded. 
"It worked." She let them help her up. "I made contact with Stefan. I talked to 


him. Now all we can do is wait and see if he's coming or not." 
"Did you mention Elena?" Matt asked. 
"Yes." 
"Then he's coming."

Monday, June 8, 11:15 prev.m.


Dear Diary, 


I don't seem to be sleeping very well tonight, so I might as well write you. All 
day today I've been waiting for something to happen. You don't do a spell like that 
and have it work like that and then have nothing happen. 


But nothing has. I stayed home from school because Mom thought I should. She 
was upset about Matt and Meredith staying so late Sunday night, and she said I 
needed to get some rest. But every time I lie down I see Sue's face. 


Sue's dad did the eulogy at Elena's funeral. I wonder who's going to do it for 
Sue on Wednesday? 


I've got to stop thinking about things like this. 


Maybe I'll try to go to sleep again. Maybe if I lie down with my headphones on, 
I won't see Sue. 


Bonnie put the diary back in her nightstand drawer and took out her Walkman. 


Page 34 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
She flipped through the channels as she stared at the ceiling with heavy eyes. 

Through the crackle and sputter of static a D.J.'s voice sounded in her ear. 
"And here's a golden oldie for all you fabulous fifties fans. 'Goodnight 
Sweetheart' on the Vee Jay label by The Spaniels..." 

Bonnie drifted away on the music. 
The ice cream soda was strawberry, Bonnie's favorite. The jukebox was playing 


'Goodnight Sweetheart' and the counter was squeaky clean. But Elena, Bonnie 
decided, would never have really worn a poodle skirt. 
"No poodles," she said, gesturing at it. Elena looked up from her hot fudge 

sundae. Her blond hair was pulled back in a ponytail. "Who thinks of these things 
anyway?" Bonnie asked. 

"You do, silly. I'm only visiting." 
"Oh." Bonnie took a pull at the soda. Dreams. There was a reason to be afraid of 
dreams, but she couldn't think of it just now. 


"I can't stay long," Elena said. "I think he already knows I'm here. I just came to 


tell you..." She frowned. 
Bonnie looked at her sympathetically. "Can't you remember either?" She drank 
more soda. It tasted odd. 


"I died too young, Bonnie. There was so much I was supposed to do, to 


. 
accomplish. And now I have to help you." 
accomplish. And now I have to help you." 
"This isn't easy, you know. I don't have that much power. It's hard getting 


through, and it's hard keeping everything together." 


"Gotta keep it together," Bonnie agreed, nodding. She was feeling strangely 
lightheaded. What was in this soda? 
"I don't have much control, and things turn out strange somehow. He's doing it, I 


guess. He's always fighting me. He watches you. And every time we try to 
communicate, he comes." 

"Okay." The room was floating. 
"Bonnie, are you listening to me? He can use your fear against you. It's the way he 
gets in." 


"Okay..." 


Page 35 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
"But don't let him in. Tell everyone that. And tell Stefan..." Elena stopped and 
put a hand to her mouth. Something fell onto the hot fudge sundae. 

It was a tooth. 

"He's here." Elena's voice was strange, indistinct. Bonnie stared at the tooth in 
mesmerized horror. It was lying in the middle of the whipped cream, among the 
slivered almonds. "Bonnie, tell Stefan..." 

Another tooth plunked down, and another. Elena sobbed, both her hands at her 
mouth now. Her eyes were terrified, helpless. "Bonnie, don't go..." 

But Bonnie was stumbling back. Everything was whirling around. The soda was 
bubbling out of the glass, but it wasn't soda; it was blood. Bright red and frothy, like 
something you coughed up when you died. Bonnie's stomach convulsed. 

"Tell Stefan I love him!" It was the voice of a toothless old woman, and it ended 
in hysterical sobs. Bonnie was glad to fall into darkness and forget everything. 

Bonnie nibbled at the end of her felt pen, her eyes on the clock, her mind on the 
calendar. Eight and a half more days of school to survive. And it looked as if every 
minute was going to be misery. 

Some guy had said it outright, backing away from her on the stairs. "No offense, 
but your friends keep turning up dead." Bonnie had gone into the bathroom and 
cried. 

But now all she wanted was to be out of school, away from the tragic faces and 
accusing eyes-or worse, the pitying eyes. The principal had given a speech over 
the P.A. about "this new misfortune" and "this terrible loss," and Bonnie had felt the 
eyes on her back as if they were boring holes there. 

When the bell rang, she was the first person out the door. But instead of going to 
her next class she went to the bathroom again, where she waited for the next bell. 


Then, once the halls were empty, she hurried toward the foreign language wing. She 
passed bulletins and banners for end-of-the-year events without glancing at them. 
What did SATs matter, what did graduation matter, what did anything matter 
anymore? They might all be dead by the end of the month.

What did SATs matter, what did graduation matter, what did anything matter 
anymore? They might all be dead by the end of the month. 

Oh, my God, I forgot how gorgeous he is, she thought. Elena, forgive me; I'm 
going to grab him. 

"Stefan!" she said. 

Page 36 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
Then her mind wrenched her back into reality again and she cast a hunted look 
around. No one was in eyeshot. She grabbed his arm. 

"Are you crazy, showing up here? Are you nuts?" 

"I had to find you. I thought it was urgent." 

"It is, but-" He looked so incongruous, standing there in the high school 
hallway. So exotic. Like a zebra in a flock of sheep. She started pushing him toward 
a broom closet. 

He wasn't going. And he was stronger than she was. "Bonnie, you said you'd 
talked to-" 

"You have to hide! I'll go get Matt and Meredith and bring them back here and 
then we can talk. But if anybody sees you, you're probably going to get lynched. 
There's been another murder." 

Stefan's face changed, and he let her push him toward the closet. He started to 
say something, then clearly decided not to. 

"I'll wait," he said simply. 

It took only a few minutes to find Matt in auto tech and Meredith in economics 
class. They hurried back to the broom closet and bustled Stefan out of school as 
inconspicuously as possible, which wasn't very. 

Someone's bound to have seen us, Bonnie thought. It all depends on who, and 
how much of a blab they are. 

"We have to get him someplace safe-not to any of our houses," Meredith was 
saying. They were all walking as fast as they could through the high school parking 
lot. 

"Fine, but where? Wait a minute, what about the boarding house... ?" Bonnie's 
voice trailed off. There was a little black car in the parking slot in front of her. An 
Italian car, sleek, svelte, and sexy looking. All the windows were tinted illegally dark; 
you couldn't even see inside. Then Bonnie made out the stallion emblem on the 
back. 


"Oh, my God" 

"Oh, my God" 

Three sets of eyes turned to him in shock. "Damon's?" Bonnie said, hearing the 
squeak in her own voice. She hoped Stefan meant Damon had just loaned it to him. 

But the car window was rolling down to reveal black hair as sleek and liquidy as 
the car's paint job, mirrored glasses, and a very white smile. "Buon giorno," said 
Damon smoothly. "Anybody need a ride?" 

Page 37 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
"Oh, my God," Bonnie said again, faintly. But she didn't back away. 

Stefan was visibly impatient. "We'll head for the boarding house. You follow. 
Park behind the barn so nobody sees your car." 

Meredith had to lead Bonnie away from the Ferrari. It wasn't that Bonnie liked 
Damon or that she was ever going to let him kiss her again as he had at Alaric's 
party. She knew he was dangerous; not as bad as Katherine had been, maybe, but 
bad. He'd killed wantonly, just for the fun of it. He'd killed Mr. Tanner, the history 
teacher, at the Haunted House fund-raiser last Halloween. He might kill again at any 
time. Maybe that was why Bonnie felt like a mouse staring at a shining black snake 
when she looked at him. 

In the privacy of Meredith's car Bonnie and Meredith exchanged glances. 

"Stefan shouldn't have brought him," said Meredith. 

"Maybe he just came," Bonnie offered. She didn't think Damon was the sort of 
person who got brought anywhere. 

"Why should he? Not to help us, that's for sure." 

Matt said nothing. He didn't even seem to notice the tension in the car. He just 
stared through the windshield, lost in himself. 

The sky was clouding up. 

"Matt?" 

"Just leave it alone, Bonnie," said Meredith. 

Wonderful, thought Bonnie, depression settling like a dark blanket over her. Matt 
and Stefan and Damon, all together, all thinking about Elena. 

They parked behind the old barn, next to the low black car. When they went 
inside, Stefan was standing alone. He turned and Bonnie saw that he'd taken off his 
sunglasses. The faintest chill went through her, just the lightest prickling of the hairs 
on her arms and neck. Stefan wasn't like any other guy she'd ever met. His eyes were 
so green; green as oak leaves in the spring. But just now they had shadows 
underneath. 

There was a moment of awkwardness; the three of them standing on one side and 
looking at Stefan without a word. No one seemed to know what to say. 

Then Meredith went over to him and took his hand. "You look tired," she said. 


"I came as soon as I could." He put an arm around her in a brief, almost hesitant 
hug. He never would have done that in the old days, Bonnie thought. He used to be 
so reserved. 

Page 38 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
"I came as soon as I could." He put an arm around her in a brief, almost hesitant 
hug. He never would have done that in the old days, Bonnie thought. He used to be 
so reserved. 

Stefan and Matt were looking at each other. Here we go, thought Bonnie. It was 
almost funny; the same expression was on both their faces. Hurt and tired, and trying 
not to show it. No matter what, Elena would always be between them. 

At last, Matt stuck out his hand and Stefan shook it. They both stepped back, 
looking glad to have it over with. 

"Where's Damon?" said Meredith. 

"Poking around. I thought we might want a few minutes without him." 

"We want a few decades without him," Bonnie said before she could stop herself, 
and Meredith said, "He can't be trusted, Stefan." 

"I think you're wrong," Stefan said quietly. "He can be a big help if he puts his 
mind to it." 

"In between killing a few of the locals every other night?" Meredith said, her 
eyebrows up. "You shouldn't have brought him, Stefan." 

"But he didn't." The voice came from behind Bonnie, behind and frighteningly 
close. Bonnie jumped and made an instinctive lunge for Matt, who gripped her 
shoulder. 

Damon smiled briefly, just one corner of his mouth up. He'd taken off his 
sunglasses, but his eyes weren't green. They were black as the spaces between the 
stars. He's almost better looking than Stefan, Bonnie thought wildly, finding Matt's 
fingers and hanging on to them. 

"So she's yours now, is she?" Damon said to Matt casually. 

"No," Matt said, but his grip on Bonnie didn't loosen. 

"Stefan didn't bring you?" prompted Meredith from the other side. Of all of them, 
she seemed least affected by Damon, least afraid of him, least susceptible to him. 

"No," Damon said, still looking at Bonnie. He doesn't turn like other people, she 
thought. He goes on looking at whatever he wants no matter who's talking. "You 
did," he said. 

"Me?" Bonnie shrank a little, uncertain who he meant. 

"You. You did the spell, didn't you?" 

"The..." Oh, hell. A picture blossomed in Bonnie's mind, of black hair on a white 
napkin. Her eyes went to Damon's hair, finer and straighter than Stefan's but just as

dark. Obviously Matt had made a mistake in the sorting. 


dark. Obviously Matt had made a mistake in the sorting. 


They took seats on the decaying bales of hay, all except Damon, who remained 
standing. Stefan was leaning forward, hands on knees, looking at Bonnie. 


"You told me-you said that Elena spoke to you." There was a perceptible pause 
before he got the name out. His face was tense with control. 


"Yes." She managed a smile for him. "I had this dream, Stefan, this very strange 
dream..." 


She told him about it, and about what had happened after. It took a long time. 
Stefan listened intently, his green eyes flaring every time she mentioned Elena. When 
she told about the end of Caroline's party and how they had found Sue's body in the 
backyard, the blood drained from his face, but he said nothing. 


"The police came and said she was dead, but we knew that already," Bonnie 
finished. "And they took Vickie away-poor Vickie was just raving. They wouldn't 
let us talk to her, and her mother hangs up if we call. Some people are even saying 
Vickie did it, which is insane. But they won't believe that Elena talked to us, so they 
won't believe anything she said." 


"And what she said was 'he,' " Meredith interrupted. "Several times. It's a man; 
someone with a lot of psychic power." 


"And it was a man who grabbed my hand in the hallway," said Bonnie. She told 
Stefan about her suspicion of Tyler, but as Meredith pointed out, Tyler didn't fit the 
rest of the description. 


He had neither the brains nor the psychic power to be the one Elena was warning 
them about. 


"What about Caroline?" Stefan asked. "Could she have seen anything?" 


"She was out front," Meredith said. "She found the door and got out while we 
were all running. She heard the screams, but she was too frightened to go back in the 
house. And to be honest, I don't blame her." 


"So nobody actually saw what happened except Vickie." 


"No. And Vickie's not telling." Bonnie picked up the story where she had left off. 
"Once we realized nobody would believe us, we remembered Elena's message about 
the summoning spell. We figured it must have been you she wanted to summon, 
because she thought you could do something to help. So... can you?" 


"I can try," Stefan said. He got up and walked a little distance away, turning his 
back on them. He stood like that in silence a while, unmoving. At last he turned back 


Page 40 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
and looked Bonnie in the eyes. "Bonnie," he said, quiet but intense, "in your dreams 
you actually spoke to Elena face to face. Do you think if you went into a trance you 
could do it again?" 

Bonnie was a little frightened by what she saw in his eyes. They were blazing 


emerald green in his pale face. All at once it was as if she could see behind the mask 
of control he wore. Underneath was so much pain, so much longing-so much of 
that intensity that she could hardly bear to look at it.

"Then we'll do it. Right here, right now. And we'll see if you can take me with 
you." Those eyes were mesmerizing, not with any hidden Power, but with the sheer 
force of his will. Bonnie wanted to do it for him-he made her want to do anything 
for him. But the memory of that last dream was too much. She couldn't face that 
horror again; she couldn't. 

"Stefan, it's too dangerous. I could be opening myself up to anything-and I'm 
scared. If that thing gets hold of my mind, I don't know what might happen. I can't, 
Stefan. Please. Even with a Ouija board, it's just inviting him to come." 

For a moment she thought he was going to try to make her do it. His mouth 
tightened in an obstinate line, and his eyes blazed even brighter. But then, slowly, the 
fire died out of them. 

Bonnie felt her heart tear. "Stefan, I'm sorry," she whispered. 

"We'll just have to do it on our own," he said. The mask was back on, but his 
smile looked stiff, as if it hurt him. Then he spoke more briskly. "First we have to 
find out who this killer is, what he wants here. All we know now is that something 
evil has come to Fell's Church again." 

"But why?" said Bonnie. "Why would anything evil just happen to pick here? 
Haven't we been through enough?" 

"It does seem a bit of a strange coincidence," Meredith said drolly. "Why should 
we be so singularly blessed?" 

"It's not coincidence," said Stefan. He got up and lifted his hands as if unsure 
how to start. "There are some places on this earth that are... different," he said. 
"That are full of psychic energy, either positive or negative, good or evil. Some of 
them have always been that way, like the Bermuda Triangle and Salisbury Plain, the 
place where they built Stonehenge. Others become that way, especially where a lot of 
blood has been shed." He looked at Bonnie. 

"Unquiet spirits," she whispered.

"Yes. There was a battle here, wasn't there?" 


"In the Civil War," Matt said. "That's how the church in the cemetery got ruined. 
It was a slaughter on both sides. Nobody won, but almost everyone who fought got 
killed. The woods are full of their graves." 


"And the ground was soaked with blood. A place like that draws the supernatural 
to it. It draws evil to it. That's why Katherine was attracted to Fell's Church in the 
first place. I felt it too, when I first came here." 


"And now something else has come," Meredith said, perfectly serious for once. 
"But how are we supposed to fight it?" 


. 
"We have to know what we're fighting first. I think..." But before he could finish, 
there was a creak and pale, dusty sunlight fell across the bales of hay. The barn door 
had opened. 


"We have to know what we're fighting first. I think..." But before he could finish, 
there was a creak and pale, dusty sunlight fell across the bales of hay. The barn door 
had opened. 


Mrs. Flowers, who owned the boarding house, smiled at them, her little black 
eyes crinkling into wrinkles. She was carrying a tray. 


"I thought you children might like something to drink while you're talking," she 
said comfortably. 


Everyone exchanged disconcerted glances. How had she known they were out 
here? And how could she be so calm about it? 


"Here you go," Mrs. Flowers continued. "This is grape juice, made from my own 
Concord grapes." She put a paper cup beside Meredith, then Matt, then Bonnie. 
"And here are some gingersnap cookies. Fresh." She held the plate around. Bonnie 
noticed she didn't offer any to Stefan or Damon. 


"You two can come round to the cellar if you like and try some of my blackberry 
wine," she said to them, with what Bonnie would swear was a wink. 


Stefan took a deep, wary breath. "Uh, look, Mrs. Flowers..." 


"And your old room's just like you left it. Nobody's been up there since you 
went. You can use it when you want; it won't put me out a bit." 


Stefan seemed at a loss for words. "Well-thank you. Thank you very much. But 
-" 


"If you're worried I'll say something to somebody, you can set your mind at ease. 
I don't tend to run off at the mouth. Never have, never will. How's that grape juice?" 
-turning suddenly on Bonnie. 


Page 42 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
Bonnie hastily took a gulp. "Good," she said truthfully. 

"When you finish, throw the cups in the trash. I like things kept tidy." Mrs. 
Flowers cast a look about the barn, shaking her head and sighing. "Such a shame. 
Such a pretty girl." She looked at Stefan piercingly with eyes like onyx beads. 
"You've got your work cut out for you this time, boy," she said, and left, still 
shaking her head. 

"Well!" said Bonnie, staring after her, amazed. Everyone else just looked at each 
other blankly. 

" 'Such a pretty girl'-but which?" said Mere-dith at last. "Sue or Elena?" Elena 
had actually spent a week or so in this very barn last winter-but Mrs. Flowers 
wasn't supposed to know that. "Did you say something to her about us?" Meredith 
asked Damon. 

"Not a word." Damon seemed amused. "She's an old lady. She's batty." 

"She's sharper than any of us gave her credit for," Matt said. "When I think of the 


days we spent watching her potter around that basement-do you think she knew we 
were watching?" 

days we spent watching her potter around that basement-do you think she knew we 
were watching?" 

"And grape juice, don't forget that." Matt grinned at Stefan. "Want some?" He 
proffered the leaky cup. 

"Yeah, you can take your grape juice and..." But Stefan was almost smiling 
himself. For an instant Bonnie saw the two of them the way they used to be, before 
Elena had died. Friendly, warm, as comfortable together as she and Meredith were. 
A pang went through her. 

But Elena isn't dead, she thought. She's more here than ever. She's directing 
everything we say and do. 

Stefan had sobered again. "When Mrs. Flowers came in, I was about to say that 
we'd better get started. And I think we should start with Vickie." 

"She won't see us," Meredith replied instantly. "Her parents are keeping everyone 
away." 

"Then we'll just have to bypass her parents," Stefan said. "Are you coming with 
us, Damon?" 

"A visit to yet another pretty girl? I wouldn't miss it." 

Bonnie turned to Stefan in alarm, but he spoke reassuringly as he guided her out 
of the barn. "It'll be all right. I'll keep an eye on him." 

Page 43 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
Bonnie hoped so. 


Six 

Vickie's house was on a corner, and they approached it from the side street. By 
now the sky was filled with heavy purple clouds. The light had an almost underwater 
quality. 

"Looks like it's going to storm," Matt said. 

Bonnie glanced at Damon. Neither he nor Stefan liked bright light. And she could 
feel the Power emanating from him, like a low thrum just under the surface of his 
skin. He smiled without looking at her and said, "How about snow in June?" 
Bonnie clamped down on a shiver. 
She had looked Damon's way once or twice in the barn and found him listening to 

the story with an air of detached indifference. Unlike Stefan, his expression hadn't 
changed in the slightest when she mentioned Elena-or when she told about Sue's 
death. What did he really feel for Elena? He'd called up a snowstorm once and left 
her to freeze in it. What was he feeling now? Did he even care about catching the 
murderer? 

"That's Vickie's bedroom," said Meredith. "The bay window in the back." 
Stefan looked at Damon. "How many people in the house?" 
"Two. Man and woman. The woman's drunk." 
Poor Mrs. Bennett, thought Bonnie. 
"I need them both asleep," Stefan said. 
In spite of herself, Bonnie was fascinated by the surge of Power she felt from 


Damon. Her psychic abilities had never been strong enough to sense its raw essence 
before, but now they were. Now she could feel it as clearly as she could see the 
fading violet light or smell the honeysuckle outside Vickie's window. 

Damon shrugged. "They're asleep." 
Stefan tapped lightly on the glass. 
There was no response, or at least none Bonnie could see. But Stefan and Damon 
looked at each other. 
"She's half tranced already," Damon said. 


Page 44 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
"She's scared. I'll do it; she knows me," said Stefan. He put his fingertips on the 

window. "Vickie, it's Stefan Salvatore," he said. "I'm here to help you. Come let me 
in." 
His voice was quiet, nothing that should have been heard on the other side of the 

glass. But after a moment the curtains stirred and a face appeared. 
Bonnie gasped aloud. 
Vickie's long, light brown hair was disheveled, and her skin was chalky. There 
. 


were huge black rings under her eyes. The eyes themselves were fixed and glassy. 


Her lips were rough and chapped. 
were huge black rings under her eyes. The eyes themselves were fixed and glassy. 
Her lips were rough and chapped. 


"She looks possessed," Bonnie whispered back, unnerved. 
Stefan just said, "Vickie, open the window." 
Mechanically, like a windup doll, Vickie cranked one of the side panels of the bay 


window open, and Stefan said, "Can I come in?" 
Vickie's glazed eyes swept over the group outside. For a moment Bonnie thought 


she didn't recognize any of them. But then she blinked and said slowly, "Meredith... 
Bonnie... Stefan? You're back. What are you doing here?" 
"Ask me in, Vickie." Stefan's voice was hypnotic. 
"Stefan..." There was a long pause and then: "Come in." 
She stepped back as he put a hand on the sill and vaulted through. Matt followed 
him, then 
Meredith. Bonnie, who was wearing a mini, re-mained outside with Damon. She 


wished she'd worn jeans to school today, but then she hadn't known she'd be going 
on an expedition. 
"You shouldn't be here," Vickie said to Stefan, almost calmly. "He's coming to 
get me. He'll get you too." 
Meredith put an arm around her. Stefan just said, "Who?" 
"Him. He comes to me in my dreams. He killed Sue." Vickie's matter-of-fact tone 


Page 45 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
was more frightening than any hysteria could have been. 

"Vickie, we've come to help you," Meredith said gently. "Everything's going to be 
all right now. We won't let him hurt you, I promise." 

Vickie swung around to stare at her. She looked Meredith up and down as if 
Meredith had suddenly changed into something unbelievable. Then she began to 
laugh. 

It was awful, a hoarse burst of mirth like a hacking cough. It went on and on until 
Bonnie wanted to cover her ears. Finally Stefan said, "Vickie, stop it." 

The laughter died into something like sobs, and when Vickie lifted her head again, 
she looked less glassy eyed but more genuinely upset. "You're all going to die, 
Stefan," she said, shaking her head. "No one can fight him and live." 

"We need to know about him so we can fight him. We need your help," Stefan 
said. "Tell me what he looks like." 

"I can't see him in my dreams. He's just a shadow without a face." Vickie 
whispered it, her shoulders hunching. 

"But you saw him at Caroline's house," Stefan said insistently. "Vickie, listen to 


me," he added as the girl turned away sharply. "I know you're frightened, but this is 
important, more important than you can understand. We can't fight him unless we 
know what we're up against, and you are the only one, the only one right now who 
has the information we need. You have to help us." 

me," he added as the girl turned away sharply. "I know you're frightened, but this is 
important, more important than you can understand. We can't fight him unless we 
know what we're up against, and you are the only one, the only one right now who 
has the information we need. You have to help us." 

Stefan's voice was unyielding. "I have a way to help you remember," he said. 
"Will you let me try?" 

Seconds crawled by, then Vickie gave a long, bubbling sigh, her body sagging. 
"Do whatever you want," she said indifferently. "I don't care. It won't make any 
difference." 

"You're a brave girl. Now look at me, Vickie. I want you to relax. Just look at me 
and relax." Stefan's voice dropped to a lulling murmur. It went on for a few minutes, 
and then Vickie's eyes drooped shut. 

"Sit down." Stefan guided her to sit on the bed. He sat beside her, looking into 
her face. 

"Vickie, you feel calm and relaxed now. Nothing you remember will hurt you," he 
said, his voice soothing. "Now, I need you to go back to Saturday night. You're 

Page 46 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
upstairs, in the master bedroom of Caroline's house. Sue Carson is with you, and 
someone else. I need you to see-" 

"No!" Vickie twisted back and forth as if trying to escape something. "No! I can't 
-" 

"Vickie, calm down. He won't hurt you. He can't see you, but you can see him. 
Listen to me." 

As Stefan spoke, Vickie's whimpers quieted. But she still thrashed and writhed. 

"You need to see him, Vickie. Help us fight him. What does he look like?" 

"He looks like the devil!" 

It was almost a scream. Meredith sat on Vickie's other side and took her hand. 
She looked out through the window at Bonnie, who looked back wide eyed and 
shrugged slightly. Bonnie had no idea what Vickie was talking about. 

"Tell me more," Stefan said evenly. 

Vickie's mouth twisted. Her nostrils were flared as if she were smelling something 
awful. When she spoke, she got out each word separately, as if they were making 
her sick. 

"He wears... an old raincoat. It flaps around his legs in the wind. He makes the 
wind blow. His hair is blond. Almost white. It stands up all over his head. His eyes 
are so blue-electric blue." Vickie licked her lips and swallowed, looking nauseated. 
"Blue is the color of death." 

Thunder rumbled and cracked in the sky. Damon glanced up quickly, then 
frowned, eyes narrowed. 


"He's tall. And he's laughing. He's reaching for me, laughing. But Sue screams 
'No, no' and tries to pull me away. So he takes her instead. The window's broken, 
and the balcony is right there. Sue's crying 'No, please.' And then I watch him-I 
watch him throw her..." Vickie's breath was hitching, her voice rising hysterically.

"Oh, please, no-Sue! Sue! Sue!" 

"Vickie, stay with me. Listen. I need just one more thing. Look at him. Tell me if 
he's wearing a blue jewel-" 

But Vickie was whipping her head back and forth, sobbing, more hysterical each 
second. "No! No! I'm next! I'm next!" Suddenly, her eyes sprang open as she came 

Page 47 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
out of the trance by herself, choking and gasping. Then her head jerked around. 

On the wall, a picture was rattling. 

It was picked up by the bamboo-framed mirror, then by perfume bottles and 
lipsticks on the dresser below. With a sound like popcorn, earrings began bursting 
from an earring tree. The rattling got louder and louder. A straw hat fell off a hook. 
Photos were showering down from the mirror. Tapes and CDs sprayed out of a rack 
and onto the floor like playing cards being dealt. 


Meredith was on her feet and so was Matt, fists clenched. 


"Make it stop! Make it stop!" Vickie cried wildly. 


But it didn't stop. Matt and Meredith looked around as new objects joined the 
dance. Everything movable was shaking, jittering, swaying. It was as if the room 
were caught in an earthquake. 


"Stop! Stop!" shrieked Vickie, her hands over her ears. 


Directly above the house thunder exploded. 


Bonnie jumped violently as she saw the zigzag of lightning shoot across the sky. 
Instinctively she grabbed for something to hang on to. As the lightning bolt flared a 
poster on Vickie's wall tore diagonally as if slashed by a phantom knife. Bonnie 
choked back a scream and clutched tighter. 


Then, as quickly as if someone had flicked a power switch off, all the noise 
stopped. 


Vickie's room was still. The fringe on the bedside lamp swayed slightly. The 
poster had curled up in two irregular pieces, top and bottom. Slowly, Vickie lowered 
her hands from her ears. 


Matt and Meredith looked around rather shakily. 


Bonnie shut her eyes and murmured something like a prayer. It wasn't until she 
opened them again that she realized what she had been hanging on to. It was the 
supple coolness of a leather jacket. It was Damon's arm. 


He hadn't moved away from her, though. He didn't move now. He was leaning 
forward slightly, eyes narrowed, watching the room intently. 


. 
"Look at the mirror," he said. 


"Look at the mirror," he said. 


On the glass surface of the bamboo mirror two words were scrawled in Vickie's 
hot coral lipstick. 


Page 48 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
Goodnight, Sweetheart. 

"Oh, God," Bonnie whispered. 

Stefan turned from the mirror to Vickie. There was something different about him, 
Bonnie thought-he was holding himself relaxed but poised, like a soldier who's just 
gotten confirmation of a battle. It was as if he'd accepted a personal challenge of 
some kind. 


He took something out of his back pocket and unfolded it, revealing sprigs of a 
plant with long green leaves and tiny lilac flowers. 


"This is vervain, fresh vervain," he said quietly, his voice even and intense. "I 
picked it outside Florence; it's blooming there now." He took Vickie's hand and 
pressed the packet into it. "I want you to hold on to this and keep it. Put some in 
every room of the house, and hide pieces somewhere in your parents' clothes if you 
can, so they'll have it near them. As long as you have this with you, he can't take 
over your mind. He can scare you, Vickie, but he can't make you do anything, like 
open a window or door for him. And listen, Vickie, because this is important." 


Vickie was shivering, her face crumpled. Stefan took both her hands and made 
her look at him, speaking slowly and distinctly. 


"If I'm right, Vickie, he can't get in unless you let him. So talk to your parents. 
Tell them it's important that they don't ask any stranger inside the house. In fact, I 
can have Damon put that suggestion in their mind right now." He glanced at Damon, 
who shrugged slightly and nodded, looking as if his attention was somewhere else. 
Self-consciously, Bonnie removed her hand from his jacket. 


Vickie's head was bent over the vervain. 


"He'll get in somehow," she said softly, with terrible certainty. 


"No. Vickie, listen to me. From now on, we're going to watch your house; we're 
going to be waiting for him." 


"It doesn't matter," Vickie said. "You can't stop him." She began to laugh and 
cry at the same time. 


"We're going to try," Stefan said. He looked at Meredith and Matt, who nodded. 
"Right. From this moment on, you will never be alone. There will always be one or 
more of us outside watching you." 


Vickie just shook her bent head. Meredith gave her arm a squeeze and stood as 
Stefan tilted his head toward the window. 


When she and Matt joined him there, Stefan spoke to all of them in a low voice. "I 


. 
don't want to leave her unguarded, but I can't stay myself right now. There's 
something I have to do, and I need one of the girls with me. On the other hand, I 


Page 49 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
don't want to leave either Bonnie or Meredith alone here." He turned to Matt. "Matt, 
will you..." 

don't want to leave her unguarded, but I can't stay myself right now. There's 
something I have to do, and I need one of the girls with me. On the other hand, I 
don't want to leave either Bonnie or Meredith alone here." He turned to Matt. "Matt, 
will you..." 

Everyone looked at him, startled. 

"Well, it's the logical solution, isn't it?" Damon seemed amused. "After all, what 
do you expect one of them to do against him anyway?" 

"They can call for me. I can monitor their thoughts that far," Stefan said, not 
giving one inch. 

"Well," Damon said whimsically, "I can call for you too, little brother, if I get into 
trouble. I'm getting bored with this investigation of yours anyway. I might as well 
stay here as anywhere." 

"Vickie needs to be protected, not abused," Stefan said. 

Damon's smile was charming. "Her?" He nodded toward the girl who sat on the 
bed, rocking over the vervain. From disheveled hair to bare feet, Vickie was not a 
pretty picture. "Take my word for it, brother, I can do better than that." For just an 
instant Bonnie thought those dark eyes flicked sideways toward her. "You're always 
saying how you'd like to trust me, anyway," Damon added. "Here's your chance to 
prove it." 

Stefan looked as if he wanted to trust, as if he were tempted. He also looked 
suspicious. Damon said nothing, merely smiled in that taunting, enigmatic way. 
Practically asking to be mistrusted, Bonnie thought. 

The two brothers stood looking at each other while the silence and the tension 
stretched out between them. Just then Bonnie could see the family resemblance in 
their faces, one serious and intense, the other bland and faintly mocking, but both 
inhumanly beautiful. 

Stefan let his breath out slowly. "All right," he said quietly at last. Bonnie and Matt 
and Meredith were all staring at him, but he didn't seem to notice. He spoke to 
Damon as if they were the only two people there. "You stay here, outside the house 
where you won't be seen. I'll come back and take over when I'm finished with what 
I'm doing." 

Meredith's eyebrows were in her hair, but she made no comment. Neither did 
Matt. Bonnie tried to quell her own feelings of unease. Stefan must know what he's 
doing, she told herself. Anyway, he'd better. 

"Don't take too long," Damon said dismissively. 

And that was how they left it, with Damon blending in with the darkness in the 

Page 50 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
shadow of the black walnut trees in Vickie's backyard and Vickie herself in her 
room, rocking endlessly. 


In the car, Meredith said, "Where next?" 


. 
"I need to test a theory," said Stefan briefly. 
"That the killer is a vampire?" Matt said from the back, where he sat with Bonnie. 
Stefan glanced at him sharply. "Yes." 
"That's why you told Vickie not to invite anyone in," Meredith added, not to be 


outdone in the reasoning department. Vampires, Bonnie remembered, couldn't enter 
a place where humans lived and slept unless they were invited. "And that's why you 
asked if the man was wearing a blue stone." 


"An amulet against daylight," Stefan said, spreading his right hand. On the third 
finger there was a silver ring set with lapis lazuli. "Without one of these, direct 
exposure to the sun kills us. If the murderer is a vampire, he keeps a stone like this 
somewhere on him." As if by instinct, Stefan reached up to briefly touch something 
under his T-shirt. After a moment Bonnie realized what it must be. 


Elena's ring. Stefan had given it to her in the first place, and after she died he'd 
taken it to wear on a chain around his neck. So that part of her would be with him 
always, he'd said. 


When Bonnie looked at Matt beside her, she saw his eyes were closed. 
"So how can we tell if he's a vampire?" Meredith asked. 
"There's only one way I can think of, and it isn't very pleasant. But it's got to be 
done." 


Bonnie's heart sank. If Stefan thought it wasn't very pleasant, she was sure she 
was going to find it even less so. "What is it?" she said unenthusiastically. 
"I need to get a look at Sue's body." 
There was dead silence. Even Meredith, normally so unflappable, looked 
appalled. Matt turned away, leaning his forehead against the window glass. 
"You've got to be kidding," Bonnie said. 
"I wish I were." 
"But-for God's sake, Stefan. We can't. They won't let us. I mean, what are we 
going to say? 'Excuse me while I examine this corpse for holes'?" 


Page 51 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
"Bonnie, stop it," Meredith said. 

"I can't help it," Bonnie snapped back shakily. "It's an awful idea. And besides, 
the police already checked her body. There wasn't a mark on it except the cuts she 
got in the fall." 

"The police don't know what to look for," Stefan said. His voice was steely. 
Hearing it brought something home to Bonnie, something she tended to forget. 
Stefan was one of them. One of the hunters. He'd seen dead people before. He 
might even have killed some. 

He drinks blood, she thought, and shuddered. 

"Well?" said Stefan. "Are you still with me?" 


Bonnie tried to make herself small in the backseat. Meredith's hands were tight on 
the steering wheel. It was Matt who spoke, turning back from the window. 

Bonnie tried to make herself small in the backseat. Meredith's hands were tight on 
the steering wheel. It was Matt who spoke, turning back from the window. 

"There's a viewing of the body from seven to ten at the funeral home," Meredith 
added, her voice low. 

"We'll have to wait until after the viewing, then. After they close the funeral home, 
when we can be alone with her," said Stefan. 

"This is the most gruesome thing I've ever had to do," Bonnie whispered 
wretchedly. The funeral chapel was dark and cold. Stefan had sprung the locks on 
the outside door with a thin piece of flexible metal. 

The viewing room was thickly carpeted, its walls covered with somber oak 
panels. It would have been a depressing place even with the lights on. In the dark it 
seemed close and suffocating and crowded with grotesque shapes. It looked as if 
someone might be crouching behind each of the many standing flower arrangements. 

"I don't want to be here," Bonnie moaned. 

"Let's just get it over with, okay?" Matt said through his teeth. 

When he snapped the flashlight on, Bonnie looked anywhere but where it was 
pointing. She didn't want to see the coffin, she didn't. She stared at the flowers, at a 
heart made of pink roses. Outside, thunder grumbled like a sleeping animal. 

"Let me get this open-here," Stefan was saying. In spite of her resolve not to, 
Bonnie looked. 

The casket was white, lined with pale pink satin. Sue's blond hair shone against it 
like the hair of a sleeping princess in a fairy tale. But Sue didn't look as if she were 
sleeping. She was too pale, too still. Like a waxwork. 

Page 52 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
Bonnie crept closer, her eyes fixed on Sue's face. 

That's why it's so cold in here, she told herself staunchly. To keep the wax from 
melting. It helped a little. 

Stefan reached down to touch Sue's high-necked pink blouse. He undid the top 
button. 

"For God's sake," Bonnie whispered, outraged. 

"What do you think we're here for?" Stefan hissed back. But his fingers paused 
on the second button. 

Bonnie watched a minute and then made her decision. "Get out of the way," she 
said, and when Stefan didn't move immediately, she gave him a shove. Meredith 
drew up close to her and they formed a phalanx between Sue and the boys. Their 
eyes met with understanding. If they had to actually remove the blouse, the guys 
were going out. 

Bonnie undid the small buttons while Meredith held the light. Sue's skin felt as 


waxy as it looked, cool against her fingertips. Awkwardly, she folded the blouse 
back to reveal a lacy white slip. Then she made herself push Sue's shining gold hair 
off the pale neck. The hair was stiff with spray.

"No," said Stefan oddly. "But there's something else. Look at this." Gently, he 
reached around Bonnie to point out a cut, pale and bloodless as the skin around it, 
but visible as a faint line running from collarbone to breast. Over the heart. Stefan's 
long finger traced the air above it and Bonnie stiffened, ready to smack the hand 
away if he touched. 

"What is it?" asked Meredith, puzzled. 

"A mystery," Stefan said. His voice was still odd. "If I saw a mark like that on a 
vampire, it would mean the vampire was giving blood to a human. That's how it's 
done. Human teeth can't pierce our skin, so we cut ourselves if we want to share 
blood. But Sue wasn't a vampire." 

"She certainly wasn't!" said Bonnie. She tried to fight off the image her mind 
wanted to show her, of Elena bending to a cut like that on Stefan's chest and 
sucking, drinking... 

She shuddered and realized her eyes were shut. "Is there anything else you need 
to see?" she said, opening them. 

Page 53 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
"No. That's all." 
Bonnie did up the buttons. She rearranged Sue's hair. Then, while Meredith and 


Stefan eased the lid of the casket back down, she walked quickly out of the viewing 
room and to the outside door. She stood there, arms wrapped around herself. 
A hand touched her elbow lightly. It was Matt. 
"You're tougher than you look," he said. 
"Yes, well..." She tried to shrug. And then suddenly she was crying, crying hard. 


Matt put his arms around her. 


"I know," he said. Just that. Not "Don't cry" or "Take it easy" or "Everything's 
going to be all right." Just "I know." His voice was as desolate as she felt. 
"They've got hair spray in her hair," she sobbed. "Sue never used hair spray. It's 

awful." Somehow, just then, this seemed the worst thing of all. 
He simply held her. 
After a while Bonnie got her breath. She found she was holding on to Matt almost 


painfully tightly and loosened her arms. "I got your shirt all wet," she said 
apologetically, sniffling. 

"It doesn't matter." 
Something in his voice made her step back and look at him. He looked the way he 
had in the high school parking lot. So lost, so... hopeless. 


. 
"Matt, what is it?" she whispered. "Please." 


"Matt, what is it?" she whispered. "Please." 
"I'm not so sure." Bonnie didn't even think she wanted to. It was too scary. But 
she was overwhelmed by an urge to comfort him, to wipe that lost look from his 
eyes. "Matt, I-" 


"We're finished," Stefan said from behind them. 
As Matt looked toward the voice the lost look seemed to intensify. "Sometimes I 


think we're all finished," Matt said, moving away from Bonnie, but he didn't explain 
what he meant by that. "Let's go." 


Seven 

Stefan approached the corner house reluctantly, almost afraid of what he might 
find. He half expected that Damon would have abandoned his post by now. He'd 

Page 54 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
probably been an idiot to rely on Damon in the first place. 
But when he reached the backyard, there was a shimmer of motion among the 


black walnut trees. His eyes, sharper than a human's because they were adapted for 
hunting, made out the darker shadow leaning against a trunk. 
"You took your time getting back." 
"I had to see the others home safe. And I had to eat." 
"Animal blood," Damon said contemptuously, eyes fixed on a tiny round stain on 


Stefan's T-shirt. "Rabbit, from the smell of it. That seems appropriate somehow, 
doesn't it?" 
"Damon-I've given Bonnie and Meredith vervain too." 


"A wise precaution," Damon said distinctly, and showed his teeth. 
A familiar surge of irritation welled up in Stefan. Why did Damon always have to 
be so difficult? Talking with him was like walking between land mines. 


"I'll be going now," Damon continued, swinging his jacket over one shoulder. 
"I've got business of my own to take care of." He tossed a devastating grin over his 
shoulder. "Don't wait up." 

"Damon." Damon half turned, not looking but listening. "The last thing we need is 
some girl in this town screaming 'Vampire!' " Stefan said. "Or showing the signs, 
either. These people have been through it before; they're not ignorant." 

"I'll bear that in mind." It was said ironically, but it was the closest thing to a 
promise Stefan had ever gotten from his brother in his life. 
"And, Damon?" 
"Now what?" 


"Thank you." 
It was too much. Damon whipped around, his eyes cold and uninviting, a 
stranger's eyes. 


"Don't expect anything of me, little brother," he said dangerously. "Because you'll 
be wrong every time. And don't think you can manipulate me, either. Those three 
humans may follow you, but I won't. I'm here for reasons of my own." 

He was gone before Stefan could gather words for a reply. It wouldn't have 
mattered anyway. Damon never listened to anything he said. Damon never even 
called him by name. It was always the scornful "little brother." 

And now Damon was off to prove how unreliable he was, Stefan thought. 
Wonderful. He'd do something particularly vicious just to show Stefan he was 

Page 55 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
. 
capable of it. 


capable of it. 


It was no use. He couldn't keep his mind on the puzzle. He was tired and lonely 
and in desperate need of comfort. And the stark truth was that there was no comfort 
to be had. 


Elena, he thought, you lied to me. 


It was the one thing she'd insisted on, the one thing she'd always promised. 
"Whatever happens, Stefan, I'll be with you. Tell me you believe that." And he had 
answered, helpless in her spell, "Oh, Elena, I believe it. Whatever happens, we'll be 
together." 


But she had left him. Not by choice maybe, but what did that matter in the end? 
She had left him and gone away. 


There were times when all he wanted was to follow her. 


Think about something else, anything else, he told himself, but it was too late. 
Once unleashed, the images of Elena swirled around him, too painful to bear, too 
beautiful to push away. 


The first time he'd kissed her. The shock of dizzy sweetness when his mouth met 
hers. And after that, shock after shock, but at some deeper level. As if she were 
reaching down to the core of himself, a core he'd almost forgotten. 


Frightened, he'd felt his defenses tear away. All his secrets, all his resistance, all 
the tricks he used to keep other people at arm's length. Elena had ripped through 
them all, exposing his vulnerability. 


Exposing his soul. 


And in the end, he found that it was what he wanted. He wanted Elena to see him 
without defenses, without walls. He wanted her to know him for what he was. 


Terrifying? Yes. When she'd discovered his secret at last, when she'd found him 
feeding on that bird, he had cringed in shame. He was sure that she'd turn away from 
the blood on his mouth in horror. In disgust. 


But when he looked into her eyes that night, he saw understanding. Forgiveness. 
Love. 


Her love had healed him. 


And that was when he knew they could never be apart. 


Other memories surged up and Stefan held on to them, even though the pain tore 


Page 56 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
into him like claws. Sensations. The feel of Elena against him, supple in his arms. 
The brush of her hair on his cheek, light as a moth's wing. The curve of her lips, the 


. 
taste of them. The impossible midnight blue of her eyes. 


taste of them. The impossible midnight blue of her eyes. 


But Bonnie had reached Elena. Elena's spirit, her soul, was still somewhere near. 


Of anyone, he should be able to summon it. He had Power at his command. And 
he had more right than anyone to seek her. 


He knew how it was done. Shut your eyes. Picture the person you want to draw 
near. That was easy. He could see Elena, feel her, smell her. Then call them, let your 
longing reach out into the emptiness. Open yourself and let your need be felt. 


Easier still. He didn't give a damn about the danger. He gathered all his yearning, 
all his pain, and sent it out searching like a prayer. 


And felt... nothing. 


Only void and his own loneliness. Only silence. 


His Power wasn't the same as Bonnie's. He couldn't reach the one thing he loved 
most, the one thing that mattered to him. 


He had never felt so alone in his life. 


"You want what?" Bonnie said. 


"Some sort of records about the history of Fell's Church. Particularly about the 
founders," Stefan said. They were all sitting in Meredith's car, which was parked a 
discreet distance behind Vickie's house. It was dusk of the next day and they had 
just returned from Sue's funeral-all but Stefan. 


"This has something to do with Sue, doesn't it?" Meredith's dark eyes, always so 
level and intelligent, probed Stefan's. "You think you've solved the mystery." 


"Possibly," he admitted. He had spent the day thinking. He'd put the pain of last 
night behind him, and once again he was in control. Although he could not reach 
Elena, he could justify her faith in him-he could do what she wanted done. And 
there was a comfort in work, in concentration. In keeping all emotion away. He 
added, "I have an idea about what might have happened, but it's a long shot and I 
don't want to talk about it until I'm sure." 


"Why?" demanded Bonnie. Such a contrast to Meredith, Stefan thought. Hair as 
red as fire and a spirit to go with it. That delicate heart-shaped face and fair, 
translucent skin were deceptive, though. Bonnie was smart and resourceful-even if 
she was only beginning to find that out herself. 


Page 57 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
"Because if I'm wrong, an innocent person might get hurt. Look, at this point it's 
just an idea. But I promise if I find any evidence tonight to back it up, I'll tell you all 
about it." 

"You could talk with Mrs. Grimesby," Meredith suggested. "She's the town 
librarian, and she knows a lot about the founding of Fell's Church." 

"Or there's always Honoria," Bonnie said. "I mean, she was one of the founders." 


Stefan looked at her quickly. "I thought Honoria Fell had stopped communicating 
with you," he said carefully. 

Stefan looked at her quickly. "I thought Honoria Fell had stopped communicating 
with you," he said carefully. 

Stefan was surprised. He didn't entirely like the idea of Elena's journal on display. 
But Honoria's records might be exactly what he was looking for. Honoria had not 
just been a wise woman; she had been well versed in the supernatural. A witch. 

"The library's closed by now, though," Meredith said. 

"That's even better," said Stefan. "No one will know what information we're 
interested in. Two of us can go down there and break in, and the other two can stay 
here. Meredith, if you'll come with me-" 

"I'd like to stay here, if you don't mind," she said. "I'm tired," she added in 
explanation, seeing his expression. "And this way I can get my watch over with and 
get home earlier. Why don't you and Matt go and Bonnie and I stay here?" 

Stefan was still looking at her. "Okay," he said slowly. "Fine. If it's all right with 
Matt." Matt shrugged. "That's it, then. It might take us a couple of hours or more. 
You two stay in the car with the doors locked. You should be safe enough that 
way." If he was right in his suspicions, there wouldn't be any more attacks for a 
while-a few days at least. Bonnie and Meredith should be safe. But he couldn't help 
wonder what was behind Meredith's suggestion. Not simple tiredness, he was sure. 

"By the way, where's Damon?" Bonnie asked as he and Matt started to leave. 

Stefan felt his stomach muscles tighten. "I don't know." He had been waiting for 
someone to ask that. He hadn't seen his brother since last night, and he had no idea 
what Damon might be doing. 

"He'll show up eventually," he said, and closed the door on Meredith's, "That's 
what I'm afraid of." 

He and Matt walked to the library in silence, keeping to the shadows, skirting 
areas of light. He couldn't afford to be seen. Stefan had come back to help Fell's 
Church, but he felt sure Fell's Church didn't want his help. He was a stranger again, 
an intruder here. They would hurt him if they caught him. 

Page 58 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
The library lock was easy to pick, just a simple spring mechanism. And the 
journals were right where Bonnie had said they would be. 

Stefan forced his hand away from Elena's journal. Inside was the record of 
Elena's last days, in her own handwriting. If he started thinking about that now... 

He concentrated on the leather-bound book beside it. The faded ink on the 
yellowing pages was hard to read, but after a few minutes his eyes got accustomed 
to the dense, intricate writing with its elaborate curlicues. 

It was the story of Honoria Fell and her husband, who with the Smallwoods and a 
few other families had come to this place when it was still virgin wilderness. They 


had faced not only the dangers of isolation and hunger but of native wildlife. Honoria 
told the story of their battle to survive simply and clearly, without sentimentality. 

had faced not only the dangers of isolation and hunger but of native wildlife. Honoria 
told the story of their battle to survive simply and clearly, without sentimentality. 

With a prickling at the back of his neck, he reread the entry carefully. At last he 
leaned back and shut his eyes. 

He'd been right. There was no longer any doubt in his mind. And that meant he 
must also be right about what was going on in Fell's Church now. For an instant, 
bright sickness washed over him, and an anger that made him want to rip and tear 
and hurt something. Sue. Pretty Sue who had been Elena's friend had died for... 
that. A blood ritual, an obscene initiation. It made him want to kill. 

But then the rage faded, replaced by a fierce determination to stop what was 
happening and set things right. 

I promise you, he whispered to Elena in his own mind. I will stop it somehow. 
No matter what. 

He looked up to find Matt looking at him. 

Elena's journal was in Matt's hand, closing itself over his thumb. Just then Matt's 
eyes looked as dark a blue as Elena's. Too dark, full of turmoil and grief and 
something like bitterness. 

"You found it," Matt said. "And it's bad." 

"Yes." 

"It would be." Matt pushed Elena's journal back into the case and stood. There 
was a ring almost of satisfaction in his voice. Like somebody who's just proved a 
point. 

"I could have saved you the trouble of coming here." Matt surveyed the darkened 
library, jingling change in his pocket. A casual observer might have thought he was 

Page 59 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
relaxed, but his voice betrayed him. It was raw with strain. "You just think of the 
worst thing you can imagine and that's always the truth," he said. 

"Matt..." Sudden concern stabbed at Stefan. He'd been too preoccupied since 
coming back to Fell's Church to look at Matt properly. Now he realized that he'd 
been unforgivably stupid. Something was terribly wrong. Matt's whole body was 
rigid with tension lying just under the surface. And Stefan could sense the anguish, 
the desperation in his mind. 

"Matt, what is it?" he said quietly. He got up and crossed to the other boy. "Is it 
something I did?" 

"I'm fine." 

"You're shaking." It was true. Fine tremors were running through the taut muscles. 

"I said I'm fine!" Matt swung away from him, shoulders hunched defensively. 
"Anyway, what could you have done to upset me? Besides taking my girl and getting 
her killed, I mean?" 


This stab was different, it was somewhere around Stefan's heart and it went 
straight through. Like the blade that had killed him once upon a time. He tried to 
breathe around it, not trusting himself to speak. 

This stab was different, it was somewhere around Stefan's heart and it went 
straight through. Like the blade that had killed him once upon a time. He tried to 
breathe around it, not trusting himself to speak. 

"It was the truth." Stefan waited a moment and then added, levelly, "But it's not 
the whole problem, is it?" 

Matt didn't answer. He stared at the floor, pushing something invisible with the 
side of one shoe. Just when Stefan was about to give up, he turned with a question 
of his own. 

"What's the world really like?" 

"What's... what?" 

"The world. You've seen a lot of it, Stefan. You've got four or five centuries on 
the rest of us, right? So what's the deal? I mean, is it basically the kind of place 
worth saving or is it essentially a pile of crap?" 

Stefan shut his eyes. "Oh." 

"And what about people, huh, Stefan? The human race. Are we the disease or just 
a symptom? I mean, you take somebody like-like Elena." Matt's voice shook 
briefly, but he went on. "Elena died to keep the town safe for girls like Sue. And now 
Sue's dead. And it's all happening again. It's never over. We can't win. So what does 
that tell you?" 

Page 60 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
"Matt." 


"What I'm really asking is, what's the point? Is there some cosmic joke I'm not 
getting? Or is the whole thing just one big freaking mistake? Do you understand what 
I'm trying to say here?" 


"I understand, Matt." Stefan sat down and ran his hands through his hair. "If 
you'll shut up a minute, I'll try to answer you." 


Matt drew up a chair and straddled it. "Great. Take your best shot." His eyes 
were hard and challenging, but underneath Stefan saw the bewildered hurt that had 
been festering there. 


"I've seen a lot of evil, Matt, more than you can imagine," Stefan said. "I've even 
lived it. It's always going to be a part of me, no matter how I fight it. Sometimes I 
think the whole human race is evil, much less my kind. And sometimes I think that 
enough of both our races is evil that it doesn't matter what happens to the rest. 


"When you get down to it, though, I don't know any more than you do. I can't tell 
you if there's a point or if things are ever going to turn out all right." Stefan looked 
straight into Matt's eyes and spoke deliberately. "But I've got another question for 
you. So what?" 


Matt stared. "So what?" 


. 
"Yeah. So what." 


"Yeah. So what." 


"Yeah, so what?" Stefan leaned forward. "So what are you going to do, Matt 
Honeycutt, if every bad thing you've said is true? What are you going to do 
personally? Are you going to stop fighting and swim with the sharks?" 


Matt was grasping the back of his chair. "What are you talking about?" 


"You can do that, you know. Damon says so all the time. You can join up with 
the evil side, the winning side. And nobody can really blame you, because if the 
universe is that way, why shouldn't you be that way too?" 


"Like hell!" Matt exploded. His blue eyes were searing and he had half risen from 
his chair. "That's Damon's way, maybe! But just because it's hopeless doesn't mean 
it's all right to stop fighting. Even if I knew it was hopeless, I'd still have to try. I 
have to try, damn it!" 


"I know." Stefan settled back and smiled faintly. It was a tired smile, but it 
showed the kinship he felt right then with Matt. And in a moment he saw by Matt's 
face that Matt understood. 


"I know because I feel the same way," Stefan continued. "There's no excuse for 


Page 61 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
giving up just because it looks like we're going to lose. We have to try-because the 
other choice is to surrender." 

"I'm not ready to surrender anything," Matt said through his teeth. He looked as 
if he'd fought his way back to a fire inside him that had been burning all along. 
"Ever," he said. 

"Yeah, well, 'ever' is a long time," Stefan said. "But for what it's worth, I'm going 
to try not to either. I don't know if it's possible, but I'm going to try." 

"That's all anybody can do," Matt said. Slowly, he pushed himself off the chair 
and stood straight. The tension was gone from his muscles, and his eyes were the 
clear, almost piercing blue eyes Stefan remembered. "Okay," he said quietly. "If you 
found what you came for, we'd better get back to the girls." 

Stefan thought, his mind switching gears. "Matt, if I'm right about what's going 
on, the girls should be okay for a while. But you go ahead and take over the watch 
from them. As long as I'm here there's something I'd like to read up on-by a guy 
named Gervase of Tilbury, who lived in the early 1200s." 

"Even before your time, eh?" Matt said, and Stefan gave him the ghost of a smile. 
They stood for a moment, looking at each other. 

"All right. I guess I'll see you at Vickie's." Matt turned to the door, then hesitated. 
Abruptly, he turned again and held out his hand. "Stefan-I'm glad you came back." 

Stefan gripped it. "I'm glad to hear it" was all he said, but inside he felt a warmth 
that took away the stabbing pain. 

And some of the loneliness, too. 


Eight 

From where Bonnie and Meredith sat in the car, they could just see Vickie's 
window. It would have been better to be closer, but then someone might have 
discovered them. 

Meredith poured the last of the coffee out of the thermos and drank it. Then she 
yawned. She caught herself guiltily and looked at Bonnie. 

"You having trouble sleeping at night too?" 

"Yes. I can't imagine why," Meredith said. 

"Do you think the guys are having a little talk?" 

Meredith glanced at her quickly, obviously surprised, then smiled. Bonnie realized 
Meredith hadn't expected her to catch on. "I hope so," Meredith said. "It might do 
Matt some good." 

Page 62 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
Bonnie nodded and relaxed back into the seat. Meredith's car had never seemed 
so comfortable before. 


When she looked at Meredith again, the dark-haired girl was asleep. 


Oh, great. Terrific. Bonnie stared into the dregs of her coffee mug, making a face. 
She didn't dare relax again; if they both fell asleep, it could be disastrous. She dug 
her nails into her palms and stared at Vickie's lighted window. 


When she found the image blurring and doubling on her, she knew something had 
to be done. 


Fresh air. That would help. Without bothering to be too quiet about it, she 
unlocked the door and pulled the handle up. The door clicked open, but Meredith 
went on breathing deeply. 


She must really be tired, Bonnie thought, getting out. She shut the door more 
gently, locking Meredith inside. It was only then that she realized she herself didn't 
have a key. 


Oh, well, she'd wake Meredith to let her back in. Meanwhile she'd go check on 
Vickie. Vickie was probably still awake. 


The sky was brooding and overcast, but the night was warm. Behind Vickie's 
house the black walnut trees stirred very faintly. Crickets sang, but their monotonous 
chirping only seemed like part of a larger silence. 


The scent of honeysuckle filled Bonnie's nostrils. She tapped on Vickie's window 
lightly with her fingernails, peering through the crack in the curtains. 


No answer. On the bed she could make out a lump of blankets with unkempt 
brown hair sticking out the top. Vickie was asleep too. 


As Bonnie stood there, the silence seemed to thicken around her. The crickets 
weren't singing anymore, and the trees were still. And yet it was as if she was 


. 
straining to hear something she knew was there. 


straining to hear something she knew was there. 


None of her ordinary senses told her this. But her sixth sense, the one that sent 
chills up her arms and ice down her spine, the one that was newly awakened to the 
presence of Power, was certain. There was... something... near. Something... 
watching her. 


She turned slowly, afraid to make a sound. If she didn't make any noise, maybe 
whatever it was wouldn't get her. Maybe it wouldn't notice her. 


The silence had become deadly, menacing. It hummed in her ears with the beat of 


Page 63 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
her own blood. And she couldn't help imagining what might come screaming out of 
it at any minute. 

Something with hot, moist hands, she thought, staring into the darkness of the 
backyard. Black on gray, black on black was all she could see. Every shape might 
be anything, and all the shadows seemed to be moving. Something with hot, sweaty 
hands and arms strong enough to crush her-

The snap of a twig exploded through her like gunfire. 

She spun toward it, eyes and ears straining. But there was only darkness and 
silence. 

Fingers touched the back of her neck. 

Bonnie whirled again, almost falling, almost fainting. She was too frightened to 
scream. When she saw who it was, shock robbed all her senses and her muscles 
collapsed. She would have ended up in a heap on the ground if he hadn't caught her 
and held her straight. 

"You look frightened," Damon said softly. 

Bonnie shook her head. She didn't have any voice yet. She thought she still might 
faint. But she tried to pull away just the same. 

He didn't tighten his grip, but he didn't let go. And struggling did about as much 
good as trying to break a brick wall with bare hands. She gave up and tried to calm 
her breathing. 

"Are you frightened of me?" Damon said. He smiled reprovingly, as if they shared 
a secret. "You don't need to be." 

How had Elena managed to deal with this? But Elena hadn't, of course, Bonnie 
realized. 

Elena had succumbed to Damon in the end. Damon had won and had his way. 

He released one of her arms to trace, very lightly, the curve of her upper lip. "I 
suppose I should go away," he said, "and not scare you anymore. Is that what you 
want?" 

Like a rabbit with a snake, Bonnie thought. This is how the rabbit feels. Only I 
don't suppose he'll kill me. I might just die on my own, though. She felt as if her legs 


might melt away at any minute, as if she might collapse. There was a warmth and a 
trembling inside her. 

might melt away at any minute, as if she might collapse. There was a warmth and a 
trembling inside her. 

Page 64 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
Elena wouldn't like it, she thought, just as his lips touched hers. Yes, that was it. 
But the problem was, she didn't have the strength to say it. The warmth was 
growing, rushing out to all parts of her, from her fingertips to the soles of her feet. 
His lips were cool, like silk, but everything else was so warm. She didn't need to be 
afraid; she could just let go and float on this. Sweetness rushed through her... 

"What the hell is going on?" 

The voice broke the silence, broke the spell. Bonnie started and found herself able 
to turn her head. Matt was standing at the edge of the yard, his fists clenched, his 
eyes like chips of blue ice. Ice so cold it burned. 

"Get away from her," Matt said. 

To Bonnie's surprise, the grip on her arms eased. She stepped back, straightening 
her blouse, a little breathless. Her mind was working again. 

"It's okay," she said to Matt, her voice almost normal. "I was just-" 

"Go back to the car and stay there." 

Now wait a minute, thought Bonnie. She was glad Matt had come; the 
interruption had been very conveniently timed. But he was coming on a little heavy 
with the protective older brother bit. 

"Look, Matt-" 

"Go on," he said, still staring at Damon. 

Meredith wouldn't have let herself be ordered around this way. And Elena 
certainly wouldn't. Bonnie opened her mouth to tell Matt to go sit in the car himself 
when she suddenly realized something. 

This was the first time in months she'd seen Matt really care about anything. The 
light was back in those blue eyes-that cold flash of righteous anger that used to 
make even Tyler Smallwood back down. Matt was alive right now, and full of 
energy. He was himself again. 

Bonnie bit her lip. For a moment she struggled with her pride. Then she 
conquered it and lowered her eyes. 

"Thanks for rescuing me," she murmured, and left the yard. 

Matt was so angry he didn't dare move closer to Damon for fear he might take a 
swing at him. And the chilling darkness in Damon's eyes told him that wouldn't be a 
very good idea. 

But Damon's voice was smooth, almost dispassionate. "My taste for blood isn't 
just a whim, you know. It's a necessity you're interfering with here. I'm only doing 



Page 65 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
what I have to." 

what I have to." 

Contemptuously he said, "Why don't you pick on somebody your own size, 
then?" 

Damon smiled and the air went colder. "Like you?" 

Matt just stared at him. He could feel muscles clench in his jaw. After a moment 
he said tightly, "You can try." 

"I can do more than try, Matt." Damon took a single step toward him like a 
stalking panther. Involuntarily, Matt thought of jungle cats, of their powerful spring 
and their sharp, tearing teeth. He thought of what Tyler had looked like in the 
Quonset hut last year when Stefan was through with him. Red meat. Just red meat 
and blood. 

"What was that history teacher's name?" Damon was saying silkily. He seemed 
amused now, enjoying this. "Mr. Tanner, wasn't it? I did more than try with him." 

"You're a murderer." 

Damon nodded, unoffended, as if he'd just been introduced. "Of course, he stuck 
a knife in me. I wasn't planning to drain him quite dry, but he annoyed me and I 
changed my mind. You're annoying me now, Matt." 

Matt had his knees locked to keep from running. It was more than the catlike 
stalking grace, it was more than those unearthly black eyes fastened on his. There 
was something inside Damon that whispered terror to the human brain. Some 
menace that spoke directly to Matt's blood, telling him to do anything to get away. 

But he wouldn't run. His conversation with Stefan was blurred in his mind right 
now, but he knew one thing from it. Even if he died here, he wouldn't run. 

"Don't be stupid," Damon said, as if he'd heard every word of Matt's thoughts. 
"You've never had blood taken from you by force, have you? It hurts, Matt. It hurts 
a lot." 

Elena, Matt remembered. That first time when she'd taken his blood he'd been 
scared, and the fear had been bad enough. But he'd been doing it of his own volition 
then. What would it be like when he was unwilling? 

I will not run. I will not look away. 

Aloud he said, still looking straight at Damon, "If you're going to kill me, you'd 
better stop talking and do it. Because maybe you can make me die, but that's all you 
can make me do." 

"You're even stupider than my brother," Damon said. With two steps he crossed 
the distance to Matt. He grabbed Matt by his T-shirt, one hand on either side of the 

Page 66 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
throat. "I guess I'll have to teach you the same way." 
. 


Everything was frozen. Matt could smell his own fear, but he wouldn't move. He 
couldn't move now. 
Everything was frozen. Matt could smell his own fear, but he wouldn't move. He 


couldn't move now. 


Damon's teeth were a white glitter in the dark. Sharp as carving knives. Matt could 
almost feel the razor bite of them before they touched him. 
I will not surrender anything, he thought, and closed his eyes. 
The shove took him completely off balance. He stumbled and fell backward, his 


eyes flying open. Damon had let go and pushed him away. 
Expressionless, those black eyes looked down at him where he sat in the dirt. 
"I'll try to put this in a way you can understand," Damon said. "You don't want to 


mess with me, Matt. I am more dangerous than you can possibly imagine. Now get 


out of here. It's my watch." 
Silently, Matt got up. He rubbed at his shirt where Damon's hands had crumpled 
it. And then he left, but he didn't run and he didn't flinch from Damon's eyes. 


I won, he thought. I'm still alive, so I won. 


And there had been a kind of grim respect in those black eyes in the end. It made 
Matt wonder about some things. It really did. 
Bonnie and Meredith were sitting in the car when he got back. They both looked 


concerned. 
"You were gone a long time," Bonnie said. "Are you okay?" 
Matt wished people would stop asking him that. "I'm fine," he said, and then 


added, "Really." After a moment's thought he decided there was something else he 


should say. "Sorry if I yelled at you back there, Bonnie." 
"That's all right," Bonnie said coolly. Then, thawing, she said, "You really do 
look better, you know. More like your old self." 


"Yeah?" He rubbed at his crumpled T-shirt again, looking around. "Well, tangling 


with vampires is obviously a great warm-up exercise." 
"What'd you guys do? Lower your heads and run at each other from opposite 
sides of the yard?" asked Meredith. 


"Something like that. He says he's going to watch Vickie now." 


Page 67 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
"Do you think we can trust him?" Meredith said soberly. 

Matt considered. "As a matter of fact, I do. It's weird, but I don't think he's going 
to hurt her. And if the killer comes along, I think he's in for a surprise. Damon's 
spoiling for a fight. We might as well go back to the library for Stefan." 

Stefan wasn't visible outside the library, but when the car had cruised up and 
down the street once or twice he materialized out of the darkness. He had a thick 
book with him. 


"Breaking and entering and grand theft, library book," Meredith remarked. "I 
wonder what you get for that these days?" 

"Breaking and entering and grand theft, library book," Meredith remarked. "I 
wonder what you get for that these days?" 

"You mean you found it? You figured it out? Then you can tell us everything, like 
you promised," Bonnie said. "Let's go to the boarding house." 

Stefan looked slightly surprised when he heard that Damon had turned up and 
stationed himself at Vickie's, but he made no comment. Matt didn't tell him exactly 
how Damon had turned up, and he noticed Bonnie didn't either. 

"I'm almost positive about what's going on in Fell's Church. And I've got half the 
puzzle solved, anyway," Stefan said once they were all settled in his room in the 
boarding house attic. "But there's only one way to prove it, and only one way to 
solve the other half. I need help, but it isn't something I'm going to ask lightly." He 
was looking at Bonnie and Meredith as he said it. 

They looked at each other, then back at him. "This guy killed one of our friends," 
said Meredith. "And he's driving another one crazy. If you need our help, you've got 
it." 

"Whatever it takes," Bonnie added. 

"It's something dangerous, isn't it?" Matt demanded. He couldn't restrain himself. 
As if Bonnie hadn't been through enough... 

"It's dangerous, yes. But it's their fight too, you know." 

"Darn right it is," said Bonnie. Meredith was obviously trying to repress a smile. 
Finally she had to turn away and grin. 

"Matt's back," she said when Stefan asked her what the joke was. 

"We missed you," added Bonnie. Matt couldn't understand why they were all 
smiling at him, and it made him feel hot and uncomfortable. He went over to stand 
by the window. 

"It is dangerous; I won't try to kid you about that," Stefan said to the girls. "But 

Page 68 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
it's the only chance. The whole thing's a little complicated, and I'd better start at the 
beginning. We have to go back to the founding of Fell's Church..." 


He talked on late into the night. 


Thursday, June 11, 7:00 a.m. 


Dear Diary, 


I couldn't write last night, because I got in too late. Mom was upset again. 
She'd have been hysterical if she'd known what I was actually doing. Hanging out 
with vampires and planning something that may get me killed. That may get us all 
killed. 


Stefan has a plan to trap the guy who murdered Sue. It reminds me of some of 
Elena's plans-and that's what worries me. They always sounded wonderful, but 


. 
lots of the time they went wrong. 


lots of the time they went wrong. 


Anyway, we're going to do it after graduation. We're all in on it except Damon, 
who'll be watching Vickie. It's strange, but we all trust him now. Even me. Despite 
what he did to me last night, I don't think he'll let Vickie get hurt. 


I haven't had any more dreams about Elena. I think if I do, I will go absolutely 
screaming berserk. Or never go to sleep again. I just can't take any more of that. 


All right. I'd better go. Hopefully, by Sunday we'll have the mystery solved and 
die killer caught. I trust Stefan. 


I just hope I can remember my part. 


. 
Nine 


"... And so, ladies and gentlemen, I give you the class of '92!" 


Bonnie threw her cap into the air along with everyone else. We made it, she 
thought. Whatever happens tonight, Matt and Meredith and I made it to graduation. 
There had been times this last school year when she had seriously doubted they 
would. 


Considering Sue's death, Bonnie had expected the graduation ceremony to be 
listless or grim. Instead, there was a sort of frenzied excitement about it. As if 
everyone was celebrating being alive-before it was too late. 


It turned into rowdiness as parents surged forward and the senior class of Robert 


Page 69 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
E. Lee fragmented in all directions, whooping and acting up. Bonnie retrieved her 
cap and then looked up into her mother's camera lens. 
Act normal, that's what's important, she told herself. She caught a glimpse of 
Elena's aunt Judith and Robert Maxwell, the man Aunt Judith had recently married, 
standing on the sidelines. Robert was holding Elena's little sister, Margaret, by the 
hand. When they saw her, they smiled bravely, but she felt uncomfortable when they 
came her way. 
"Oh, Miss Gilbert-I mean, Mrs. Maxwell-you shouldn't have," she said as 
Aunt Judith handed her a small bouquet of pink roses. 

Aunt Judith smiled through the tears in her eyes. "This would have been a very 
special day for Elena," she said. "I want it to be special for you and Meredith, too." 

"Oh, Aunt Judith." Impulsively, Bonnie threw her arms around the older woman. 
"I'm so sorry," she whispered. "You know how much." 

"We all miss her," Aunt Judith said. Then she pulled back and smiled again and 
the three of them left. Bonnie turned from looking at them with a lump in her throat 
to look at the madly celebrating crowd. 

There was Ray Hernandez, the boy she'd gone to Homecoming with, inviting 
everybody to a party at his house that night. There was Tyler's friend Dick Carter, 
making a fool of himself as usual. Tyler was smiling brazenly as his father took 
picture after picture. Matt was listening, with an unimpressed look, to some football 
recruiter from James Mason University. Meredith was standing nearby, holding a 
bouquet of red roses and looking pensive. 

Vickie wasn't there. Her parents had kept her home, saying she was in no state to 
go out. Caroline wasn't there either. She was staying in the apartment in Heron. Her 
mother had told Bonnie's mother she had the flu, but Bonnie knew the truth. Caroline 
was scared. 

And maybe she's right, Bonnie thought, moving toward Meredith. Caroline may 
be the only one of us to make it through next week. 

Look normal, act normal. She reached Meredith's group. Meredith was wrapping 


the red-and-black tassel from her cap around the bouquet, twisting it between 
elegant, nervous fingers. 

the red-and-black tassel from her cap around the bouquet, twisting it between 
elegant, nervous fingers. 

"Be careful with that; you'll ruin it," she said aloud. 

Meredith's look of thoughtful melancholy didn't change. She went on staring at 
the tassel, kinking it up. "It doesn't seem fair," she said, "that we should get these 
and Elena shouldn't. It's wrong." 

Page 70 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
"I know; it's awful," Bonnie said. But she kept her tone light. "I wish there was 
something we could do about it, but we can't." 


"It's all wrong," Meredith went on, as if she hadn't heard. "Here we are out in the 
sunlight, graduating, and there she is under that-stone." 


"I know, I know," Bonnie said in a soothing tone. "Meredith, you're getting 
yourself all upset. Why don't you try to think about something else? Look, after you 
go out to dinner with your parents, do you want to go to Raymond's party? Even if 
we're not invited, we can crash it." 


"No!" Meredith said with startling vehemence. "I don't want to go to any party. 
How can you even think of that, Bonnie? How can you be so shallow?" 


"Well, we've got to do something ..." 


"I'll tell you what I'm doing. I'm going up to the cemetery after dinner. I'm going 
to put this on Elena's grave. She's the one who deserves it." Meredith's knuckles 
were white as she shook the tassel in her hand. 


"Meredith, don't be an idiot. You can't go up there, especially at night. That's 
crazy. Matt would say the same thing." 


"Well, I'm not asking Matt. I'm not asking anybody. I'm going by myself." 


"You can't. God, Meredith, I always thought you had some brains-" 


"And I always thought you had some sensitivity. But obviously you don't even 
want to think about Elena. Or is it just because you want her old boyfriend for 
yourself?" 


Bonnie slapped her. 


It was a good hard slap, with plenty of energy behind it. Meredith drew in a sharp 
breath, one hand to her reddening cheek. Everyone around them was staring. 


"That's it for you, Bonnie McCullough," Meredith said after a moment, in a voice 
of deadly quiet. "I don't ever want to speak to you again." She turned on her heel 
and walked away: 


"Never would be too soon for me!" Bonnie shouted at her retreating back. 


Eyes were hastily averted as Bonnie looked around her. But there was no question 
that she and Meredith had been the center of attention for several minutes past. 
Bonnie bit the inside of her cheek to keep a straight face and walked over to Matt, 


. 
who had lost the recruiter. 


who had lost the recruiter. 


Page 71 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
"Good." 

"Do you think the slap was too much? We didn't really plan that; I was just sort 
of going with the moment. Maybe it was too obvious..." 

"It was fine, just fine." Matt was looking preoccupied. Not that dull, apathetic, 
turned-in look of the last few months, but distinctly abstracted. 

"What is it? Something wrong with the plan?" Bonnie said. 

"No, no. Listen, Bonnie, I've been thinking. You were the one to discover Mr. 
Tanner's body in the Haunted House last Halloween, right?" 

Bonnie was startled. She gave an involuntary shiver of distaste. "Well, I was the 
first one to know he was dead, really dead, instead of just playing his scene. Why on 
earth do you want to talk about that now?" 

"Because maybe you can answer this question. Could Mr. Tanner have got a 
knife in Damon?" 

"What?" 

"Well, could he?" 

"I..." Bonnie blinked and frowned. Then she shrugged. "I suppose so. Sure. It 
was a Druid sacrifice scene, remember, and the knife we used was a real knife. We 
talked about using a fake one, but since Mr. Tanner was going to be lying right there 
beside it, we figured it was safe enough. As a matter of fact..." Bonnie's frown 
deepened. "I think when I found the body, the knife was in a different place from 
where we'd set it in the beginning. But then, some kid could have moved it. Matt, 
why are you asking?" 

"Just something Damon said to me," Matt said, staring off into the distance again. 
"I wondered if it could be the truth." 

"Oh." Bonnie waited for him to say more, but he didn't. "Well," she said finally, 
"if it's all cleared up, can you come back to Earth, please? And don't you think you 
should maybe put your arm around me? Just to show you're on my side and there's 
no chance you're going to show up at Elena's grave tonight with Meredith?" 

Matt snorted, but the faraway look disappeared from his eyes. For just a brief 
instant he put his arm around her and squeezed. 

D..j. vu, Meredith thought as she stood at the gate to the cemetery. The problem 
was, she couldn't remember exactly which of her previous experiences in the 
graveyard this night reminded her of. There had been so many. 

In a way, it had all started here. It had been here that Elena had sworn not to rest 
until Stefan belonged to her. She'd made Bonnie and Meredith swear to help her, too 
-in blood. How suitable, Meredith thought now. 

Page 72 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
. 
And it had been here that Tyler had assaulted Elena the night of the Homecoming 
dance. Stefan had come to the rescue, and that had been the beginning for them. 
This graveyard had seen a lot. 


And it had been here that Tyler had assaulted Elena the night of the Homecoming 
dance. Stefan had come to the rescue, and that had been the beginning for them. 
This graveyard had seen a lot. 


This graveyard had been the beginning, and the end as well. And maybe there 
would be another end tonight. 


Meredith started walking. 


I wish you were here now, Alaric, she thought. I could use your optimism and 
your savvy about the supernatural-and I wouldn't mind your muscles, either. 


Elena's headstone was in the new cemetery, of course, where the grass was still 
tended and the graves marked with wreaths of flowers. The stone was very simple, 
almost plain looking, with a brief inscription. Meredith bent down and placed her 
bouquet of roses in front of it. Then, slowly, she added the red-and-black tassel 
from her cap. In this dim light, both colors looked the same, like dried blood. She 
knelt and folded her hands quietly. And she waited. 


All around her the cemetery was still. It seemed to be waiting with her, breath held 
in anticipation. The rows of white stones stretched on either side of her, shining 
faintly. Meredith listened for any sound. 


And then she heard one. Heavy footsteps. 


With her head down, she stayed quiet, pretending she noticed nothing. 


The footsteps sounded closer, not even bothering to be stealthy. 


"Hi, Meredith." 


Meredith looked around quickly. "Oh-Tyler," she said. "You scared me. I 
thought you were-never mind." 


"Yeah?" Tyler's lips skinned back in an unsettling grin. "Well, I'm sorry you're 
disappointed. But it's me, just me and nobody else." 


"What are you doing here, Tyler? No good parties?" 


"I could ask you the same question." Tyler's eyes dropped to the headstone and 
the tassel and his face darkened. "But I guess I already know the answer. You're 
here for her. Elena Gilbert, A Light in Darkness," he read sarcastically. 


"That's right," Meredith said evenly. " 'Elena' means light, you know. And she 
was certainly surrounded by darkness. It almost beat her, but she won in the end." 


Page 73 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
"Maybe," Tyler said, and worked his jaw meditatively, squinting. "But you know, 
Meredith, it's a funny thing about darkness. There's always more of it waiting in the 
wings." 


"Like tonight," Meredith said, looking up at the sky. It was clear and dotted with 
faint stars. "It's very dark tonight, Tyler. But sooner or later the sun will come up." 

"Like tonight," Meredith said, looking up at the sky. It was clear and dotted with 
faint stars. "It's very dark tonight, Tyler. But sooner or later the sun will come up." 

Just like he showed Elena, Meredith thought. In a way she was enjoying this 
verbal fencing, but she never lost sight of what she had come here for. Her cold 
fingers dipped into her jacket pocket and found the tiny sprig of vervain there. 
"That's all right, Tyler. I think I'd prefer to stay here." 

"You sure about that? A cemetery's a dangerous place to be alone." 

Unquiet spirits, Meredith thought. She looked right at him. "I know." 

He was grinning again, displaying teeth like tombstones. "Anyway, you can see it 
from here if you have good eyes. Look that way, toward the old graveyard. Now, do 
you see something sort of shining red in the middle?" 

"No." There was a pale luminosity over the trees in the east. Meredith kept her 
eyes on it. 

"Aw, come on, Meredith. You're not trying. Once the moon's up you'll see it 
better." 

"Tyler, I can't waste any more time here. I'm going." 

"No, you're not," he said. And then, as her fingers tightened on the vervain, 
encompassing it in her fist, he added in a wheedling voice, "I mean, you're not going 
until I tell you the story of that headstone, are you? It's a great story. See, the 
headstone is made of red marble, the only one of its kind in the whole graveyard. 
And that ball on top-see it?-that must weigh about a ton. But it moves. It turns 
whenever a Smallwood is going to die. My grandfather didn't believe that; he put a 
scratch on it right down the front. He used to come out and check it every month or 
so. Then one day he came and found the scratch in the rear. The ball had turned 
completely backward. He did everything he could to turn it around, but he couldn't. 
It was too heavy. And that night, in bed, he died. They buried him under it." 

"He probably had a heart attack from overexertion," Meredith said caustically, but 
her palms were tingling. 

"You're funny, aren't you? Always so cool. Always so together. Takes a lot to 
make you scream, doesn't it?" 

"I'm leaving, Tyler. I've had enough." 

Page 74 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
He let her walk a few paces, then said, "You screamed that night at Caroline's, 
though, didn't you?" 


Meredith turned back. "How do you know that?" 


Tyler rolled his eyes. "Give me credit for a little intelligence, okay? I know a lot, 
Meredith. For instance, I know what's in your pocket." 


. 
Meredith's fingers stilled. "What do you mean?" 


Meredith's fingers stilled. "What do you mean?" 


Meredith backed away a step. 


"You think that's going to help you, don't you? But I'm going to tell you a secret." 


Meredith's eyes measured the distance between herself and the path. She kept her 
face calm, but a violent shaking was beginning inside her. She didn't know if she was 
going to be able to pull this off. 


"You're not going anywhere, babe," Tyler said, and a large hand clasped 
Meredith's wrist. It was hot and damp where she could feel it below her jacket cuff. 
"You're going to stay right here for your surprise." His body was hunched now, his 
head thrust forward, and there was an exultant leer on his lips. 


"Let me go, Tyler. You're hurting me!" Panic flashed down all Meredith's nerves 
at the feel of Tyler's flesh against hers. But the hand only gripped harder, grinding 
tendon against bone in her wrist. 


"This is a secret, baby, that nobody else knows," Tyler said, pulling her close, his 
breath hot in her face. "You came here all decked out against vampires. But I'm not a 
vampire." 


Meredith's heart was pounding. "Let go!" 


"First I want you to look over there. You can see the headstone now," he said, 
turning her so that she couldn't help but look. And he was right; she could see it, like 
a red monument with a shining globe on top. Or-not a globe. That marble ball 
looked like... it looked like... 


"Now look east. What do you see there, Meredith?" Tyler went on, his voice 
hoarse with excitement. 


It was the full moon. It had risen while he'd been talking to her, and now it hung 
above the hills, perfectly round and enormously distended, a huge and swollen red 
ball. 


And that was what the headstone looked like. Like a full moon dripping with 
blood. 


Page 75 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
"You came here protected against vampires, Meredith," Tyler said from behind 
her, even more hoarsely. "But the Smallwoods aren't vampires at all. We're 
something else." 


And then he growled. 


No human throat could have made the sound. It wasn't an imitation of an animal; 
it was real. A vicious guttural snarl that went up and up, snapping Meredith's head 
around to look at him, to stare in disbelief. What she was seeing was so horrible her 


. 
mind couldn't accept it... 


mind couldn't accept it... 


"I told you it was a surprise. How do you like it?" Tyler said. His voice was thick 
with saliva, and his red tongue lolled among the rows of long canine teeth. His face 
wasn't a face anymore. It jutted out grotesquely into a muzzle, and his eyes were 
yellow, with slitlike pupils. His reddish-sandy hair had grown over his cheeks and 
down the back of his neck. A pelt. "You can scream all you want up here and 
nobody's going to hear you," he added. 


Every muscle in Meredith's body was rigid, trying to get away from him. It was a 
visceral reaction, one she couldn't have helped if she wanted to. His breath was so 
hot, and it smelled feral, like an animal. The nails he was digging into her wrist were 
stumpy blackened claws. She didn't have the strength to scream again. 


"There's other things besides vampires with a taste for blood," Tyler said in his 
new slurping voice. "And I want to taste yours. But first we're going to have some 
fun." 


Although he still stood on two feet, his body was humped and strangely distorted. 
Meredith's struggles were feeble as he forced her to the ground. She was a strong 
girl, but he was far stronger, his muscles bunching under his shirt as he pinned her. 


"You've always been too good for me, haven't you? Well, now you're going to 
find out what you've been missing." 


I can't breathe, Meredith thought wildly. His arm was across her throat, blocking 
her air. Gray waves rolled through her brain. If she passed out now... 


"You're going to wish you died as fast as Sue." Tyler's face floated above her, 
red as the moon, with that long tongue lolling. His other hand held her arms above 
her head. "You ever hear the story of Little Red Riding Hood?" 


The gray was turning into blackness, speckled with little lights. Like stars, 
Meredith thought. I'm falling in the stars... 


"Tyler, take your hands off her! Let go of her, now!" Matt's voice shouted. 


Tyler's slavering snarl broke off into a surprised whine. The arm against 


Page 76 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
Meredith's throat released pressure, and air rushed into her lungs. 

Footsteps were pounding around her. "I've been waiting a long time to do this, 
Tyler," Matt said, jerking the sandy-red head back by the hair. Then Matt's fist 
smashed into Tyler's newly grown muzzle. Blood spurted from the wet animal nose. 

The sound Tyler made froze Meredith's heart in her chest. He sprang at Matt, 
twisting in midair, claws outstretched. Matt fell back under the assault and Meredith, 
dizzy, tried to push herself up off the ground. She couldn't; all her muscles were 
trembling uncontrollably. But someone else picked Tyler off Matt as if Tyler 
weighed no more than a doll. 

"Just like old times, Tyler," Stefan said, setting Tyler on his feet and facing him. 

Tyler stared a minute, then tried to run. 


He was fast, dodging with animal agility between the rows of graves. But Stefan 
was faster and cut him off. 

He was fast, dodging with animal agility between the rows of graves. But Stefan 
was faster and cut him off. 

Stefan was dragging Tyler back. "I always knew you were a jerk," he said, 
shoving Tyler against a headstone, "but I didn't know you were this stupid. I'd have 
thought you would have learned not to jump girls in graveyards, but no. And you 
had to brag about what you did to Sue, too. That wasn't smart, Tyler." 

Meredith looked at them as they faced each other. So different, she thought. Even 
though they were both creatures of darkness in some way. Stefan was pale, his green 
eyes blazing with anger and menace, but there was a dignity, almost a purity about 
him. He was like some stern angel carved in unyielding marble. Tyler just looked like 
a trapped animal. He was crouched, breathing hard, blood and saliva mingling on his 
chest. Those yellow eyes glittered with hate and fear, and his fingers worked as if 
he'd like to claw something. A low sound came out of his throat. 

"Don't worry, I'm not going to beat you up this time," Stefan said. "Not unless 
you try to get away. We're all going up to the church to have a little chat. You like to 
tell stories, Tyler; well, you're going to tell me one now." 

Tyler sprang at him, vaulting straight from the ground for Stefan's throat. But 
Stefan was ready for him. Meredith suspected that both Stefan and Matt enjoyed the 
next few minutes, working off their accumulated aggressions, but she didn't, so she 
looked away. 

In the end, Tyler was trussed up with nylon cord. He could walk, or shuffle at 
least, and Stefan held the back of his shirt and guided him urgently up the path to the 
church. 

Inside, Stefan pushed Tyler onto the ground near the open tomb. "Now," he said, 
"we are going to talk. And you're going to cooperate, Tyler, or you're going to be 

Page 77 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
very, very sorry." 


Ten 

Meredith sat down on the knee-high wall of the ruined church. "You said it was 
going to be dangerous, Stefan, but you didn't say you were going to let him strangle 
me." 

"I'm sorry. I was hoping he'd give some more information, especially after he 
admitted to being there when Sue died. But I shouldn't have waited." 

"I haven't admitted anything! You can't prove anything," Tyler said. The animal 
whine was back in his voice, but on the walk up his face and body had returned to 
normal. Or rather, they'd returned to human, Meredith thought. The swelling and 
bruises and dried blood weren't normal. 

"This isn't a court of law, Tyler," she said. "Your father can't help you now." 

"But if it were, we'd have a pretty good case," Stefan added. "Enough to put you 
away on conspiracy to commit murder, I think." 

"That's if somebody doesn't melt down their grandma's teaspoons to make a 
silver bullet," Matt put in. 

Tyler looked from one to another of them. "I won't tell you anything." 

"Tyler, you know what you are? You're a bully," Bonnie said. "And bullies always 
talk." 

"You don't mind pinning a girl down and threatening her," said Matt, "but when 
her friends turn up, you're scared spitless." 

Tyler just glared at all of them. 

"Well, if you don't want to talk, I guess I'll have to," Stefan said. He leaned down 
and picked up the thick book he'd gotten from the library. One foot on the lip of the 
tomb, he rested the book on his knee and opened it. In that moment, Meredith 
thought, he looked frighteningly like Damon. 

"This is a book by Gervase of Tilbury, Tyler," he said. "It was written around the 
year 1210 a.d. One of the things it talks about is werewolves." 

"You can't prove anything! You don't have any evidence-" 

"Shut up, Tyler!" Stefan looked at him. "I don't need to prove it. I can see it, even 
now. Have you forgotten what I am?" There was a silence, and then Stefan went on. 
"When I got here a few days ago, there was a mystery. A girl was dead. But who 
killed her? And why? All the clues I could see seemed contradictory. 

Page 78 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
"It wasn't an ordinary killing, not some human psycho off the street. I had the 
word of somebody I trusted on that-and independent evidence, too. An ordinary 
killer can't work a Ouija board by telekinesis. An ordinary killer can't cause fuses to 
blow in a power plant hundreds of miles away. 


"No, this was somebody with tremendous physical and psychic power. From

everything Vickie told me, it sounded like a vampire. 


everything Vickie told me, it sounded like a vampire. 


"And there was another thing. You were in that house, Tyler. You made the 
mistake of grabbing Bonnie that night, and then you made the mistake of shooting 
off your mouth the next day, saying things you couldn't have known unless you were 
there. 


"So what did we have? A seasoned vampire, a vicious killer with Power to spare? 
Or a high school bully who couldn't organize a trip to the toilet without falling over 
his own feet? Which? The evidence pointed both ways, and I couldn't make up my 
mind. 


"Then I went to see Sue's body myself. And there it was, the biggest mystery of 
all. A cut here." Stefan's finger sketched a sharp line down from his collarbone. 
"Typical, traditional cut-made by vampires to share their own blood. But Sue 
wasn't a vampire, and she didn't make that cut herself. Someone made it for her as 
she lay there dying on the ground." 


Meredith shut her eyes, and she heard Bonnie swallow hard beside her. She put 
out a hand and found Bonnie's and held tight, but she went on listening. Stefan had 
not gone into this kind of detail in his explanation to them before. 


"Vampires don't need to cut their victims like that; they use their teeth," Stefan 
said. His upper lip lifted slightly to show his own teeth. "But if a vampire wanted to 
draw blood for somebody else to drink, he might cut instead of biting. If a vampire 
wanted to give someone else the first and only taste, he might do that. 


"And that started me thinking about blood. Blood is important, you see. For 
vampires, it gives life, Power. It's all we need for survival, and there are times when 
needing it drives us crazy. But it's good for other things, too. For instance... 
initiation. 


"Initiation and Power. Now I was thinking about those two things, putting them 
together with what I'd seen of you, Tyler, when I was in Fell's Church before. Little 
things I hadn't really focused on. But I remembered something Elena had told me 
about your family history, and I decided to check it out in Honoria Fell's journal." 


Stefan lifted a piece of paper from between the pages of the book he held. "And 
there it was, in Honoria's handwriting. I Xeroxed the page so I could read it to you. 
The Smallwoods' little family secret-if you can read between the lines." 


Page 79 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
Looking down at the paper, he read: 


"November 12. Candles made, flax spun. We are short on cornmeal and salt, 
but we will get through the winter. Last night an alarm; wolves attacked Jacob 
Smallwood as he returned from the forest. I treated the wound with whortleberry 
and sallow bark, but it is deep and I am afraid. After coming home I cast the 


. 
runes. I have told no one but Thomas the results. 


runes. I have told no one but Thomas the results. 


"December 20. Wolf trouble at the Smallwoods' again. We heard the screams a 
few minutes ago, and Thomas said it was time. He made the bullets yesterday. He 
has loaded his rifle and we will walk over. If we are spared, I will write again. 


"December 21. Went over to Smallwoods' last night. Jacob sorely afflicted. Wolf 
killed. 


"We will bury Jacob in the little graveyard at the foot of the hill. May his soul 
find peace in death. 


"In the official history of Fell's Church," Stefan said, "that's been interpreted to 
mean that Thomas Fell and his wife went over to the Smallwoods' to find Jacob 
Smallwood being attacked by a wolf again, and that the wolf killed him. But that's 
wrong. What it really says is not that the wolf killed Jacob Smallwood but that Jacob 
Smallwood, the wolf, was killed." 


Stefan shut the book. "He was a werewolf, your great-great-great-whatever 
grandfather, Tyler. He got that way by being attacked by a werewolf himself. And he 
passed his werewolf virus on to the son who was born eight and a half months after 
he died. Just the way your father passed it on to you." 


"I always knew there was something about you, Tyler," Bonnie said, and 
Meredith opened her eyes. "I never could tell what it was, but at the back of my 
mind something was telling me you were creepy." 


"We used to make jokes about it," Meredith said, her voice still husky. "About 
your 'animal magnetism and your big white teeth. We just never knew how close to 
the mark we were." 


"Sometimes psychics can sense that kind of thing," Stefan conceded. 
"Sometimes even ordinary people can. I should have seen it, but I was preoccupied. 
Still, that's no excuse. And obviously somebody else-the psychic killer-saw it 
right away. Didn't he, Tyler? A man wearing an old raincoat came to you. He was 
tall, with blond hair and blue eyes, and he made some kind of a deal with you. In 
exchange for-something-he'd show you how to reclaim your heritage. How to 
become a real werewolf. 


"Because according to Gervase of Tilbury"-Stefan tapped the book on his knee 
-"a werewolf who hasn't been bitten himself needs to be initiated. That means you 


Page 80 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
can have the werewolf virus all your life but never even know it because it's never 
activated. Generations of Smallwoods have lived and died, but the virus was 
dormant in them because they didn't know the secret of waking it up. But the man in 
the raincoat knew. He knew that you have to kill and taste fresh blood. After that, at 
the first full moon you can change." Stefan glanced up, and Meredith followed his 


gaze to the white disk of the moon in the sky. It looked clean and two dimensional 
now, no longer a sullen red globe. 

gaze to the white disk of the moon in the sky. It looked clean and two dimensional 
now, no longer a sullen red globe. 

"Very clever," said Meredith, and Matt said, "No kidding." Bonnie wet her finger 
and marked an imaginary 1 on an invisible Scoreboard. 

"I knew you wouldn't be able to resist following one of the girls here if you 
thought she'd be alone," said Stefan. "You'd think that the graveyard was the perfect 
place to kill; you'd have complete privacy. And I knew you wouldn't be able to resist 
bragging about what you'd done. I was hoping you'd tell Meredith more about the 
other killer, the one who actually threw Sue out the window, the one who cut her so 
you could drink fresh blood. The vampire, Tyler. Who is he? Where is he hiding?" 

Tyler's look of venomous hatred changed to a sneer. "You think I'd tell you that? 
He's my friend." 

"He is not your friend, Tyler. He's using you. And he's a murderer." 

"Don't get in any deeper, Tyler," Matt added. 

"You're already an accessory. Tonight you tried to kill Meredith. Pretty soon 
you're not going to be able to go back even if you want to. Be smart and stop this 
now. Tell us what you know." 

Tyler bared his teeth. "I'm not telling you anything. How're you going to make 
me?" 

The others exchanged glances. The atmosphere changed, became charged with 
tension as they all turned back to Tyler. 

"You really don't understand, do you?" Meredith said quietly. "Tyler, you helped 
kill Sue. She died for an obscene ritual so that you could change into that thing I 
saw. You were planning to kill me, and Vickie and Bonnie too, I'm sure. Do you 
think we have any pity for you? Do you think we brought you up here to be nice to 
you?" 

There was a silence. The sneer was fading from Tyler's lips. He looked from one 
face to another. 

They were all implacable. Even Bonnie's small face was unforgiving. 

Page 81 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
"Gervase of Tilbury mentions one interesting thing," Stefan said, almost 
pleasantly. "There's a cure for werewolves besides the traditional silver bullet. 
Listen." By moonlight, he read from the book on his knee. "It is commonly reported 
and held by grave and worthy doctors that if a werewolf be shorn of one of his 
members, he shall surely recover his original body. Gervase goes on to tell the 
story of Raimbaud of Auvergne, a werewolf who was cured when a carpenter cut 
off one of his hind paws. Of course, that was probably hideously painful, but the 
story goes that Raimbaud thanked the carpenter 'for ridding him forever of the 
accursed and damnable form.' " Stefan raised his head. "Now, I'm thinking that if 


Tyler won't help us with information, the least we can do is make sure he doesn't go 
out and kill again. What do the rest of you say?" 

Tyler won't help us with information, the least we can do is make sure he doesn't go 
out and kill again. What do the rest of you say?" 

"All we have to do is relieve him of one of his members," Bonnie agreed. 

"I can think of one right off," Meredith said under her breath. 

Tyler's eyes were starting to bulge. Under the dirt and blood his normally ruddy 
face had gone pale. "You're bluffing!" 

"Get the ax, Matt," said Stefan. "Meredith, you take off one of his shoes." 

Tyler kicked when she did, aiming for her face. Matt came and got his head in a 
hammer-lock. "Don't make it any worse on yourself, Tyler." 

The bare foot Meredith exposed was big, the sole as sweaty as Tyler's palms. 
Coarse hair sprouted from the toes. It made Meredith's skin crawl. 

"Let's get this over with," she said. 

"You're joking!" Tyler howled, thrashing so that Bonnie had to come and grab his 
other leg and kneel on it. "You can't do this! You can't!" 

"Keep him still," Stefan said. Working together, they stretched Tyler out, his head 
locked in Matt's arm, his legs spread and pinned by the girls. Making sure Tyler 
could see what he was doing, Stefan balanced a branch perhaps two inches thick on 
the lip of the tomb. He raised the ax and then brought it down hard, severing the 
stick with one blow. 

"It's sharp enough," he said. "Meredith, roll his pants leg up. Then tie some of 
that cord just above his ankle as tight as you can for a tourniquet. Otherwise he'll 
bleed out." 

"You can't do this!" Tyler was screaming. "You can't dooooooo this!" 

"Scream all you want, Tyler. Up here, nobody's going to hear you, right?" Stefan 
said. 

Page 82 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
"You're no better than I am!" Tyler yelled in a spray of spittle. "You're a killer 
too!" 
"I know exactly what I am," Stefan said. "Believe me, Tyler. I know. Is 
everybody ready? Good. Hold on to him; he's going to jump when I do it." 
Tyler's screams weren't even words anymore. 
Matt was holding him so that he could see Stefan kneel and take aim, hefting the 
ax blade above Tyler's ankle to gauge force and distance. 
"Now," said Stefan, raising the ax high. 
"No! No! I'll talk to you! I'll talk!" shrieked Tyler. 
Stefan glanced at him. "Too late," he said, and brought the ax down. 


It rebounded off the stone floor with a clang and a spark, but the noise was 
. 
drowned by Tyler's screaming. It seemed to take Tyler several minutes to realize that 
the blade hadn't touched his foot. He paused for breath only when he choked, and 
turned wild, bulging eyes on Stefan. 


drowned by Tyler's screaming. It seemed to take Tyler several minutes to realize that 
the blade hadn't touched his foot. He paused for breath only when he choked, and 
turned wild, bulging eyes on Stefan. 


Little whimpers were coming from Tyler's throat and there was foam on his lips. 
"I don't know his name," he gasped out. "But he looks like you said. And you're 
right; he's a vampire, man! I saw him drain a ten-point buck while it was still kicking. 
He lied to me," Tyler added, the whine creeping back into his voice. "He told me I'd 
be stronger than anybody, as strong as him. He said I could have any girl I wanted, 
any way I wanted. The creep lied." 


"He told you that you could kill and get away with it," Stefan said. 
"He said I could do Caroline that night. She had it coming after the way she 


ditched me. I wanted to make her beg-but she got out of the house somehow. I 
could have Caroline and Vickie, he said. All he wanted was Bonnie and Meredith." 
"But you just tried to kill Meredith." 
"That was now. Things are different now, stupid. He said it was all right." 
"Why?" Meredith asked Stefan in an undertone. 
"Maybe because you'd served your purpose," he said. "You'd brought me here." 


Page 83 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
Then he went on, "All right, Tyler, show us you're cooperating. Tell us how we can 
get this guy." 

"Get him? You're nuts!" Tyler burst into ugly laughter, and Matt tightened the arm 
around his throat. "Hey, choke me all you want; it's still the truth. He told me he's 
one of the Old Ones, one of the Originals, whatever that means. He said he's been 
making vampires since before the pyramids. He said he's made a bargain with the 
devil. You could stick a stake in his heart and it wouldn't do anything. You can't kill 
him." The laughter became uncontrolled. 

"Where's he hiding, Tyler?" Stefan rapped out. "Every vampire needs a place to 
sleep. Where is it?" 

"He'd kill me if I told you that. He'd eat me, man. God, if I told you what he did 
to that buck before it died..." Tyler's laughter was turning into something like sobs. 

"Then you'd better help us destroy him before he can find you, hadn't you? 
What's his weak point? How's he vulnerable?" 

"God, that poor buck..." Tyler was blubbering. 

"What about Sue? Did you cry over her?" Stefan said sharply. He picked up the 
ax. "I think," he said, "that you're wasting our time." 

The ax lifted. 

"No! No! I'll talk to you; I'll tell you something. Look, there's one kind of wood 
that can hurt him-not kill him, but hurt him. He admitted that but didn't tell me what 
it was! I swear to you that's the truth!" 


"Not good enough, Tyler," said Stefan. 
"For God's sake-I'll tell you where he's going tonight. If you get over there fast 

enough, maybe you can stop him." 
"What do you mean, where he's going tonight? Talk fast, Tyler!" 
"He's going to Vickie's, okay? He said tonight we get one each. That's helpful, 
isn't it? If you hurry, maybe you can get there!" 


Stefan had frozen, and Meredith felt her heart racing. Vickie. They hadn't even 
thought about an attack on Vickie. 
"Damon's guarding her," Matt said. "Right, Stefan? Right?" 
"He's supposed to be," Stefan said. "I left him there at dusk. If something 
happened, he should have called me..." 


Page 84 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
"You guys," Bonnie whispered. Her eyes were big and her lips were trembling. "I 
think we'd better get over there now." 

They stared at her a moment and then everyone was moving. The ax clanged on 
the floor as Stefan dropped it. 

"Hey, you can't leave me like this! I can't drive! He's gonna come back for me! 
Come back and untie my hands!" Tyler shrieked. None of them answered. 

They ran all the way down the hill and piled into Meredith's car. Meredith took off 
speeding, rounding corners dangerously fast and gliding through stop signs, but 
there was a part of her that didn't want to get to Vickie's house. That wanted to turn 
around and drive the other way. 

I'm calm; I'm the one who's always calm, she thought. But that was on the 
outside. Meredith knew very well how calm you could look on the outside when 

inside everything was breaking up. 

They rounded the last corner onto Birch Street and Meredith hit the brakes. 

"Oh, God!" Bonnie cried from the backseat. "No! No!" 

"Quick," Stefan said. "There may still be a chance." He wrenched open the door 

and was out even before the car had stopped. But in back, Bonnie was sobbing. 


Eleven 

The car skidded in behind one of the police cars that was parked crookedly in the 
street. There were lights everywhere, lights flashing blue and red and amber, lights 
blazing from the Bennett house. 

"Stay here," Matt snapped, and he plunged outside, following Stefan. 

"No!" Bonnie's head jerked up; she wanted to grab him and drag him back. The 
dizzy nausea she'd felt ever since Tyler had mentioned Vickie was overwhelming her. 
It was too late; she'd known in the first instant that it was too late. Matt was only 
going to get himself killed too. 

"You stay, Bonnie-keep the doors locked. I'll go after them." That was 
Meredith. 

"No! I'm sick of having everybody tell me to stay!" Bonnie cried, struggling with 
the seat belt, finally getting it unlocked. She was still crying, but she could see well 
enough to get out of the car and start toward Vickie's house. She heard Meredith 
right behind her. 

Page 85 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
The activity all seemed concentrated at the front: people shouting, a woman 
screaming, the crackling voices of police radios. Bonnie and Meredith headed 
straight for the back, for Vickie's window. What is wrong with this picture? Bonnie 
thought wildly as they approached. The wrongness of what she was looking at was 
undeniable, yet hard to put a finger on. Vickie's window was open-but it couldn't 
be open; the middle pane of a bay window never opens, Bonnie thought. But then 
how could the curtains be fluttering out like shirttails? 


Not open, broken. Glass was all over the gravel pathway, grinding underfoot. 
There were shards like grinning teeth left in the bare frame. Vickie's house had been 
broken into. 


"She asked him in," Bonnie cried in agonized fury. "Why did she do that? Why?" 


"Stay here," Meredith said, trying to moisten dry lips. 


"Stop telling me that. I can take it, Meredith. I'm mad, that's all. I hate him." She 
gripped Meredith's arm and went forward. 


The gaping hole got closer and closer. The curtains rippled. There was enough 
space between them to see inside. 


At the last moment, Meredith pushed Bonnie away and looked through first 
herself. It didn't matter. Bonnie's psychic senses were awake and already telling her 
about this place. It was like the crater left in the ground after a meteor has hit and 
exploded, or like the charred skeleton of a forest after a wildfire. Power and violence 
were still thrumming in the air, but the main event was over. This place had been 
violated. 


Meredith spun away from the window, doubling over, retching. Clenching her 
fists so that the nails bit into her palms, Bonnie leaned forward and looked in. 


. 
The smell was what struck her first. A wet smell, meaty and coppery. She could 
almost taste it, and it tasted like an accidentally bitten tongue. The stereo was playing 
something she couldn't hear over the screaming out front and the drumming-surf 
sound in her own ears. Her eyes, adjusting from the darkness outside, could see only 
red. Just red.

The record player clicked and the stylus swung back to the beginning. With a 
shock, Bonnie recognized the song as it started over. 


It was "Goodnight Sweetheart." 


"You monster," Bonnie gasped. Pain shot through her stomach. Her hand gripped 


Page 86 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
the window frame, tighter, tighter. "You monster, I hate you! I hate you!" 
Meredith heard and straightened up, turning. She shakily pushed back her hair and 

managed a few deep breaths, trying to look as if she could cope. "You're cutting 
your hand," she said. "Here, let me see it." 
Bonnie hadn't even realized she was gripping broken glass. She let Meredith take 

the hand, but instead of letting her examine it, she turned it over and clasped 
Meredith's own cold hand tightly. Meredith looked terrible: dark eyes glazed, lips 
blue-white and shaking. But Meredith was still trying to take care of her, still trying to 
keep it together. 

"Go on," she said, looking at her friend intently. "Cry, Meredith. Scream if you 
want to. But get it out somehow. You don't have to be cool now and keep it all 
inside. You have every right to lose it today." 

For a moment Meredith just stood there, trembling, but then she shook her head 
with a ghastly attempt at a smile. "I can't. I'm just not made that way. Come on, let 
me look at the hand." 

Bonnie might have argued, but just then Matt came around the corner. He started 
violently to see the girls standing there. 
"What are you doing-?" he began. Then he saw the window. 


"She's dead," Meredith said flatly. 
"I know." Matt looked like a bad photograph of himself, an overexposed one. 
"They told me up front. They're bringing out..." He stopped. 


"We blew it. Even after we promised her..." Meredith stopped too. There was 


nothing more to say. 
"But the police will have to believe us now," Bonnie said, looking at Matt, then 
Meredith, finding one thing to be grateful for. "They'll have to." 


"No," Matt said, "they won't, Bonnie. Because they're saying it's a suicide." 
"A suicide?. Have they seen that room? They call that a suicide?" Bonnie cried,

her voice rising. 
her voice rising. 
"Oh, my God," Meredith said, turning away. 
"They think maybe she was feeling guilty for having killed Sue." 
"Somebody broke into this house," Bonnie said fiercely. "They've got to admit 


that!" 


Page 87 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
"No." Meredith's voice was soft, as if she were very tired. "Look at the window 
here. The glass is all outside. Somebody from the inside broke it." And that's the 
rest of what's wrong with the picture, Bonnie thought. 


"He probably did, getting out," Matt said. They looked at each other silently, in 
defeat. 


"Where's Stefan?" Meredith asked Matt quietly. "Is he out front where everyone 
can see him?" 


"No, once we found out she was dead he headed back this way. I was coming to 
look for him. He must be around somewhere..." 


"Sh!" said Bonnie. The shouting from the front had stopped. So had the woman's 
screaming. In the relative stillness they could hear a faint voice from beyond the 
black walnut trees in the back of the yard. 


"-while you were supposed to be watching her!" 


The tone made Bonnie's skin break out in gooseflesh. "That's him!" Matt said. 
"And he's with Damon. Come on!" 


Once they were among the trees Bonnie could hear Stefan's voice clearly. The 
two brothers were facing each other in the moonlight. 


"I trusted you, Damon. I trusted you!" Stefan was saying. Bonnie had never seen 
him so angry, not even with Tyler in the graveyard. But it was more than anger. 


"And you just let it happen," Stefan went on, without glancing at Bonnie and the 
others as they appeared, without giving Damon a chance to reply. "Why didn't you 
do something? If you were too much of a coward to fight him, you could at least 
have called for me. But you just stood there!" 


Damon's face was hard, closed. His black eyes glittered, and there was nothing 
lazy or casual about his posture now. He looked as unbending and brittle as a pane 
of glass. He opened his mouth, but Stefan interrupted. 


"It's my own fault. I should have known better. I did know better. They all knew, 
they warned me, but I wouldn't listen." 


"Oh, did they?" Damon snapped a glance toward Bonnie on the sidelines. A chill 
went through her. 


"Stefan, wait," Matt said. "I think-" 


. 
"I should have listened!" Stefan was raging on. He didn't even seem to hear Matt. 
"I should have stayed with her myself. I promised her she would be safe-and I lied! 
She died thinking I betrayed her." Bonnie could see it in his face now, the guilt eating 
into him like acid. "If I had stayed here-" 


Page 88 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
"I should have listened!" Stefan was raging on. He didn't even seem to hear Matt. 
"I should have stayed with her myself. I promised her she would be safe-and I lied! 
She died thinking I betrayed her." Bonnie could see it in his face now, the guilt eating 
into him like acid. "If I had stayed here-" 


"And that would have been better!" Stefan cried. His chest was heaving. "I 
would rather have died with her than stood by and watched it! What happened, 
Damon?" He had gotten hold of himself now, and he was calm, too calm; his green 
eyes were burning feverishly in his pale face, his voice vicious, poisonous, as he 
spoke. "Were you too busy chasing some other girl through the bushes? Or just too 
uninterested to interfere?" 


Damon said nothing. He was just as pale as his brother, every muscle tense and 
rigid. Waves of black fury were rising from him as he watched Stefan. 


"Or maybe you enjoyed it," Stefan was continuing, moving another half step 
forward so that he was right in Damon's face. "Yes, that was probably it; you liked 
it, being with another killer. Was it good, Damon? Did he let you watch?" 


Damon's fist jerked back and he hit Stefan. 


It happened too fast for Bonnie's eye to follow. Stefan fell backward onto the soft 
ground, long legs sprawling. Meredith cried out something, and Matt jumped in front 
of Damon. 


Brave, Bonnie thought dazedly, but stupid. The air was crackling with electricity. 
Stefan raised a hand to his mouth and found blood, black in the moonlight. Bonnie 
lurched over to his side and grabbed his arm. 


Damon was coming after him again. Matt fell back before him, but not all the way. 
He dropped to his knees beside Stefan, sitting on his heels, one hand upraised. 


"Enough, you guys! Enough, all right?" he shouted. 


Stefan was trying to get up. Bonnie held on to his arm more firmly. "No! Stefan, 
don't! Don't!" she begged. Meredith grabbed his other arm. 


"Damon, leave it alone! Just leave it!" Matt was saying sharply. 


We're all crazy, getting in the middle of this, Bonnie thought. Trying to break up a 
fight between two angry vampires. They're going to kill us just to shut us up. 
Damon's going to swat Matt like a fly. 


But Damon had stopped, with Matt blocking his way. For a long moment the 
scene remained frozen, nobody moving, everybody rigid with strain. Then, slowly, 
Damon's stance relaxed. 


His hands lowered and unclenched. He drew a slow breath. Bonnie realized she'd 
been holding her own breath, and she let it out. 


Page 89 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
Damon's face was cold as a statue carved in ice. "All right, have it your way," he 
said, and his voice was cold too. "But I'm through here. I'm leaving. And this time,

brother, if you follow me, I'll kill you. Promise or no promise."

Damon hitched up his jacket, straightening it. With a glance at Bonnie that 
scarcely seemed to see her, he turned to go. Then he turned back and spoke clearly 
and precisely, each word an arrow aimed at Stefan. 


"I warned you," he said. "About what I am, and about which side would win. 
You should have listened to me, little brother. Maybe you'll learn something from 
tonight." 


"I've learned what trusting you is worth," Stefan said. "Get out of here, Damon. I 
never want to see you again." 


Without another word, Damon turned and walked away into the darkness. 


Bonnie let go of Stefan's arm and put her head in her hands. 


Stefan got up, shaking himself like a cat that had been held against its will. He 
walked a little distance from the others, his face averted from them. Then he simply 
stood there. The rage seemed to have left him as quickly as it had come. 


What do we say now? Bonnie wondered, looking up. What can we say? Stefan 
was right about one thing: they had warned him about Damon and he hadn't listened. 
He'd truly seemed to believe that his brother could be trusted. And then they'd all 
gotten careless, relying on Damon because it was easy and because they needed the 
help. No one had argued against letting Damon watch Vickie tonight. 


They were all to blame. But it was Stefan who would tear himself apart with guilt 
over this. She knew that was behind his out-of-control fury at Damon: his own 
shame and remorse. She wondered if Damon knew that, or cared. And she 
wondered what had really happened tonight. Now that Damon had left, they would 
probably never know. 


No matter what, she thought, it was better he was gone. 


Outside noises were reasserting themselves: cars being started in the street, the 
short burst of a siren, doors slamming. They were safe in the little grove of trees for 
the moment, but they couldn't stay here. 


Meredith had one hand pressed to her forehead, her eyes shut. Bonnie looked 
from her to Stefan, to the lights of Vickie's silent home beyond the trees. A wave of 
sheer exhaustion passed through her body. All the adrenaline that had been 
supporting her throughout this evening seemed to have drained away. She didn't 
even feel angry anymore at Vickie's death; only depressed and sick and very, very 
tired. She wished she could crawl into her bed at home and. pull the blankets over 


Page 90 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
her head. 

"Tyler," she said aloud. And when they all turned to look at her, she said, "We 
left him in the ruined church. And he's our last hope now. We've got to make him 
help us." 


That roused everyone. Stefan turned around silently, not speaking and not 
meeting anyone's eyes as he followed them back to the street. The police cars and 
ambulance were gone, and they drove to the cemetery without incident. 

That roused everyone. Stefan turned around silently, not speaking and not 
meeting anyone's eyes as he followed them back to the street. The police cars and 
ambulance were gone, and they drove to the cemetery without incident. 

"We left his feet untied," Matt said heavily, with a grimace of self-disgust. "He 
must have walked away since his car's still down there." Or he could have been 
taken, Bonnie thought. There was no mark on the stone floor to show which. 

Meredith went to the knee-high wall and sat down, one hand pinching the bridge 
of her nose. 

Bonnie sagged against the belfry. 

They'd failed completely. That was the long and short of it tonight. They'd lost 
and he had won. Everything they'd done today had ended in defeat. 

And Stefan, she could tell, was taking the whole responsibility on his own 
shoulders. 

She glanced at the dark, bowed head in the front seat as they drove back to the 
boarding house. Another thought occurred to her, one that sent thrills of alarm down 
her nerves. Stefan was all they had to protect them now that Damon was gone. And 
if Stefan himself was weak and exhausted... 

Bonnie bit her lip as Meredith pulled up to the barn. An idea was forming in her 
mind. It made her uneasy, even frightened, but another look at Stefan put steel in her 
resolve. 

The Ferrari was still parked behind the barn-apparently Damon had abandoned 
it. Bonnie wondered how he planned to get about the countryside, and then thought 
of wings. Velvety soft, strong black crow's wings that reflected rainbows in their 
feathers. Damon didn't need a car. 

They went into the boarding house just long enough for Bonnie to call her parents 
and say she was spending the night at Meredith's. This was her idea. But after Stefan 
had climbed the stairs to his attic room, Bonnie stopped Matt on the front porch. 

"Matt? Can I ask you a favor?" 

He swung around, blue eyes widening. "That's a loaded phrase. Every time Elena 

Page 91 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
said those particular words..." 

"No, no, this is nothing terrible. I just want you to take care of Meredith, see she's 
okay once she gets home and all." She gestured toward the other girl, who was 
already walking toward the car. 

"But you're coming with us." 

Bonnie glanced at the stairs through the open door. "No. I think I'll stay a few 
minutes. Stefan can drive me home. I just want to talk to him about something." 

Matt looked bewildered. "Talk to him about what?" 

"Just something. I can't explain now. Will you, Matt?" 


"But... oh, all right. I'm too tired to care. Do what you want. I'll see you 
tomorrow." He walked off, seeming baffled and a little angry. 

"But... oh, all right. I'm too tired to care. Do what you want. I'll see you 
tomorrow." He walked off, seeming baffled and a little angry. 

The bulb in the attic ceiling lamp was missing, and Stefan had lighted a candle. He 
was lying haphazardly on the bed, one leg off and one leg on, his eyes shut. Maybe 
asleep. Bonnie tiptoed up and fortified herself with a deep breath. 

"Stefan?" 

His eyes opened. "I thought you'd left." 

"They did. I didn't." God, he's pale, thought Bonnie. Impulsively, she plunged 
right in. 

"Stefan, I've been thinking. With Damon gone, you're the only thing between us 
and the killer. That means you've got to be strong, as strong as you can be. And, 
well, it occurred to me that maybe... you know... you might need..." Her voice 
faltered. Unconsciously she'd begun fiddling with the wad of tissues forming a 
makeshift bandage on her palm. It was still bleeding sluggishly from where she'd cut 
it on the glass. 

His gaze followed hers down to it. Then his eyes lifted quickly to her face, 
reading the confirmation there. There was a long moment of silence. 

Then he shook his head. 

"But why? Stefan, I don't want to get personal, but frankly you don't look so 
good. You're not going to be much help to anybody if you collapse on us. And... I 
don't mind, if you only take a little. I mean, I'm never going to miss it, right? And it 
can't hurt all that much. And..." Once again her voice trailed off. He was just looking 
at her, which was very disconcerting. "Well, why not?" she demanded, feeling 
slightly let down. 

Page 92 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
"Because," he said softly, "I made a promise. Maybe not in so many words, but 
-a promise just the same. I won't take human blood as food, because that means 
using a person, like livestock. And I won't exchange it with anyone, because that 
means love, and-" This time he was the one who couldn't finish. But Bonnie 
understood. 

"There won't ever be anyone else, will there?" she said. 

"No. Not for me." Stefan was so tired that his control was slipping and Bonnie 
could see behind the mask. And again she saw that pain and need, so great that she 
had to look away from him. 

A strange little chill of premonition and dismay trickled through her heart. Before, 
she had wondered if Matt would ever get over Elena, and he had, it seemed. But 
Stefan-

Stefan, she realized, the chill deepening, was different. No matter how much time 


passed, no matter what he did, he would never truly heal. Without Elena he would 
always be half himself, only half alive. 

passed, no matter what he did, he would never truly heal. Without Elena he would 
always be half himself, only half alive. 

She'd come up here to give Stefan a gift that he didn't want. But there was 
something else he did want, she realized, and only she had the power to give it to 
him. 

Without looking at him, her voice husky, she said, "Would you like to see Elena?" 

Dead silence from the bed. Bonnie sat, watching the shadows in the room sway 
and flicker. At last, she chanced a look at him out of the corner of her eye. 

He was breathing hard, eyes shut, body taut as a bowstring. Trying, Bonnie 
diagnosed, to work up the strength to resist temptation. 

And losing. Bonnie saw that. 

Elena always had been too much for him. 

When his eyes met hers again, they were grim, and his mouth was a tight line. His 
skin wasn't pale anymore but flushed with color. His body was still trembling-taut 
and keyed up with anticipation. 

"You might get hurt, Bonnie." 

"I know." 

"You'd be opening yourself up to forces beyond your control. I can't guarantee 

Page 93 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
that I can protect you from them." 

"I know. How do you want to do it?" 

Fiercely, he took her hand. "Thank you, Bonnie," he whispered. 

She felt the blood rise to her face. "That's all right," she said. Good grief, he was 
gorgeous. Those eyes... in a minute she was either going to jump him or melt into a 
puddle on his bed. With a pleasurably agonizing feeling of virtue she removed her 
hand from his and turned to the candle. 

"How about if I go into a trance and try to reach her, and then, once I make 
contact, try to find you and draw you in? Do you think that would work?" 

"It might, if I'm reaching for you too," he said, withdrawing that intensity from her 
and focusing it on the candle. "I can touch your mind... when you're ready, I'll feel 
it." 

"Right." The candle was white, its wax sides smooth and shining. The flame drew 
itself up and then fell back. Bonnie stared until she became lost in it, until the rest of 
the room blacked out around her. There was only the flame, herself and the flame. 
She was going into the flame. 

Unbearable brightness surrounded her. Then she passed through it into the dark. 


The funeral home was cold. Bonnie glanced around uneasily, wondering how she 
had gotten here, trying to gather her thoughts. She was all alone, and for some 
reason that bothered her. Wasn't somebody else supposed to be here too? She was 
looking for someone.

reason that bothered her. Wasn't somebody else supposed to be here too? She was 
looking for someone. 

Step by step, as if something were pulling her, Bonnie approached the casket. She 
didn't want to look in. She had to. There was something in that coffin waiting for 
her. 

The whole room was suffused with the soft white light of the candles. It was like 
floating in an island of radiance. But she didn't want to look... 

Moving as if in slow motion, she reached the coffin, stared at the white satin lining 
inside. It was empty. 

Bonnie closed it and leaned against it, sighing. 

Then she caught motion in her peripheral vision and whirled. 

It was Elena. 

Page 94 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
"Oh, God, you scared me," Bonnie said. 

"I thought I told you not to come here," Elena answered. 

This time her hair was loose, flowing over her shoulders and down her back, the 
pale golden white of a flame. She was wearing a thin white dress that glowed softly 
in the candlelight. She looked like a candle herself, luminous, radiant. Her feet were 
bare. 


"I came here to..." Bonnie floundered, some concept teasing around the edges of 
her mind. This was her dream, her trance. She had to remember. "I came here to let 
you see Stefan," she said. 


Elena's eyes widened, her lips parting. Bonnie recognized the look of yearning, of 
almost irresistible longing. Not fifteen minutes ago she'd seen it on Stefan's face. 


"Oh," Elena whispered. She swallowed, her eyes clouding. "Oh, Bonnie... but I 
can't." 


"Why not?" 


Tears were shining in Elena's eyes now, and her lips were trembling. "What if 
things start to change? What if he comes, and..." She put a hand to her mouth and 
Bonnie remembered the last dream, with teeth falling like rain. Bonnie met Elena's 
eyes with understanding horror. 


"Don't you see? I couldn't stand it if something like that happened," Elena 
whispered. "If he saw me like that... And I can't control things here; I'm not strong

enough. Bonnie, please don't let him through. Tell him how sorry I am. Tell him-" 
She shut her eyes, tears spilling. 


enough. Bonnie, please don't let him through. Tell him how sorry I am. Tell him-" 
She shut her eyes, tears spilling. 


"Stefan, no! Elena says-" It didn't matter. His mind was stronger than hers, and 
the instant she'd made contact he had taken over. He'd sensed the gist of her 
conversation with Elena, but he wasn't going to take no for an answer. Helplessly, 
Bonnie felt herself being overridden, felt his mind come closer, closer to the circle of 
light formed by the candelabras. She felt his presence there, felt it taking shape. She 
turned and saw him, dark hair, tense face, green eyes fierce as a falcon's. And then, 
knowing there was nothing more she could do, she stepped back to allow them to be 
alone. 


. 
Twelve 


Stefan heard a voice whisper, soft with pain, "Oh, no." 


Page 95 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
A voice that he'd never thought to hear again, that he would never forget. Ripples 
of chills poured over his skin, and he could feel a shaking start inside him. He turned 
toward the voice, his attention fixing instantly, his mind almost shutting down 
because it couldn't cope with so many sudden driving emotions at once. 

His eyes were blurred and could only discern a wash of radiance like a thousand 
candles. But it didn't matter. He could feel her there. The same presence he had 
sensed the very first day he'd come to Fell's Church, a golden white light that shone 
into his consciousness. Full of cool beauty and searing passion and vibrant life. 
Demanding that he move toward it, that he forget everything else. 

Elena. It was really Elena. 

Her presence pervaded him, filling him to his fingertips. All his hungry senses 
were fixed on that wash of luminance, searching for her. Needing her. 

Then she stepped out. 

She moved slowly, hesitantly. As if she could barely make herself do it. Stefan 
was caught in the same paralysis. 

Elena. 

He saw her every feature as if for the first time. The pale gold hair floating about 
her face and shoulders like a halo. The fair, flawless skin. The slender, supple body 
just now canted away from him, one hand raised in protest. 

"Stefan," the whisper came, and it was her voice. Her voice saying his name. But 
there was such pain in it that he wanted to run to her, hold her, promise her that 
everything would be all right. "Stefan, please... I can't..." 

He could see her eyes now. The dark blue of lapis lazuli, flecked in this light with 
gold. Wide with pain and wet with unshed tears. It shredded his guts. 

"You don't want to see me?" His voice was dry as dust. 

"I don't want you to see me. Oh, Stefan, he can make anything happen. And he'll 
find us. He'll come here..." 

Relief and aching joy flooded through Stefan. He could scarcely concentrate on 
her words, and it didn't matter. The way she said his name was enough. That "Oh, 
Stefan" told him everything he cared about. 

He moved toward her quietly, his own hand coming up to reach for hers. He saw 
the protesting shake of her head, saw that her lips were parted with her quickening 
breath. Up close, her skin had an inner glow, like a flame shining through translucent 
candle wax. Droplets of wetness were caught on her eyelashes like diamonds. 

Although she kept shaking her head, kept protesting, she did not move her hand 

Page 96 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 

away. Not even when his outspread fingers touched it, pressing against her cool 
fingertips as if they were on opposite sides of a pane of glass. 

away. Not even when his outspread fingers touched it, pressing against her cool 
fingertips as if they were on opposite sides of a pane of glass. 

He couldn't think. His heart was threatening to come through his chest. Nothing 
mattered except that she was here, that they were here together. He didn't notice the 
strange surroundings, didn't care who might be watching. 

Slowly, so slowly, he closed his hand around hers, intertwining their fingers, the 
way they were meant to be. His other hand lifted to her face. 

Her eyes closed at the touch, her cheek leaning into it. He felt the moisture on his 
fingers and a laugh caught in his throat. Dream tears. But they were real, she was 
real. Elena. 

Sweetness pierced him. A pleasure so sharp it was a pain, just to stroke the tears 
away from her face with his thumb. 

All the frustrated tenderness of the last six months, all the emotion he'd kept 
locked in his heart that long, came cascading out, submerging him. Drowning both 
of them. It took such a little movement and then he was holding her. 

An angel in his arms, cool and thrilling with life and beauty. A being of flame and 
air. She shivered in his embrace; then, eyes still shut, put up her lips. 

There was nothing cool about the kiss. It struck sparks from Stefan's nerves, 
melting and dissolving everything around it. He felt his control unraveling, the control 
he'd worked so hard to preserve since he'd lost her. Everything inside him was being 
jarred loose, all knots untied, all floodgates opened. He could feel his own tears as 
he held her to him, trying to fuse them into one flesh, one body. So that nothing 
could ever separate them again. 

They were both crying without breaking the kiss. Elena's slender arms were 
around his neck now, every inch of her fitting to him as if she had never belonged 
anywhere else. He could taste the salt of her tears on his lips and it drenched him 
with sweetness. 

He knew, vaguely, that there was something else he should be thinking about. But 
the first electric touch of her cool skin had driven reason from his mind. They were 
in the center of a whirlwind of fire; the universe could explode or crumble or burn to 
ashes for all he cared, as long as he could keep her safe. 

But Elena was trembling. 

Not just from emotion, from the intensity that was making him dizzy and drunk 
with pleasure. From fear. He could feel it in her mind and he wanted to protect her, 
to shield her and to cherish her and to kill anything that dared frighten her. With 
something like a snarl he raised his face to look around. 

Page 97 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
"What is it?" he said, hearing the predator's rasp in his own voice. "Anything that 


. 
tries to hurt you-" 


tries to hurt you-" 


"Ask me anything else and I'll do it," Stefan said. The killer would have to shred 
him nerve from nerve, muscle from muscle, cell from cell to make him leave her. 


"Stefan, it's only a dream," Elena said desperately, new tears falling. "We can't 
really touch, we can't be together. It's not allowed." 


Stefan didn't care. It didn't seem like a dream. It felt real. And even in a dream he 
was not going to give up Elena, not for anyone. No force in heaven or hell could 
make him... 


"Wrong, sport. Surprise!" said a new voice, a voice Stefan had never heard. He 
recognized it instinctively, though, as the voice of a killer. A hunter among hunters. 
And when he turned, he remembered what Vickie, poor Vickie, had said. 


He looks like the devil. 


If the devil was handsome and blond. 


He wore a threadbare raincoat, as Vickie had described. Dirty and tattered. He 
looked like any street person from any big city, except that he was so tall and his 
eyes were so clear and penetrating. Electric blue, like razor-frosted sky. His hair was 
almost white, standing straight up as if blown by a blast of chilly wind. His wide 
smile made Stefan feel sick. 


"Salvatore, I presume," he said, scraping a bow. "And of course the beautiful 
Elena. The beautiful dead Elena. Come to join her, Stefan? You two were just meant 
to be together." 


He looked young, older than Stefan, but still young. He wasn't. 


"Stefan, leave now," Elena whispered. "He can't hurt me, but you're different. He 
can make something happen that will follow you out of the dream." 


Stefan's arm stayed locked around her. 


"Bravo!" the man in the raincoat applauded, looking around as if to encourage an 
invisible audience. He staggered slightly, and if he'd been human, Stefan would have 
thought he was drunk. 


"Stefan, please," Elena whispered. 


"It would be rude to leave before we've even been properly introduced," the 
blond man said. Hands in coat pockets, he strode a step or two closer. "Don't you 


Page 98 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
want to know who I am?" 


Elena shook her head, not in negation but in defeat, and dropped it to Stefan's 
shoulder. He cupped a hand around her hair, wanting to shield every part of her from 
this madman. 


. 
"I want to know," he said, looking at the blond man over her head. 


"I want to know," he said, looking at the blond man over her head. 


"How long?" said Stefan, unimpressed. 


"A long time..." The blond man's gaze turned dreamy, as if looking back over the 
years. "I was tearing pretty white throats when your ancestors were building the 
Colosseum. I killed with Alexander's army. I fought in the Trojan War. I'm old, 
Salvatore. I'm one of the Originals. In my earliest memories I carried a bronze ax." 


Slowly, Stefan nodded. 


He'd heard of the Old Ones. They were whispered about among vampires, but no 
one Stefan had ever known had actually met one. Every vampire was made by 
another vampire, changed by the exchange of blood. But somewhere, back in time, 
had been the Originals, the ones who hadn't been made. They were where the line of 
continuity stopped. No one knew how they'd gotten to be vampires themselves. But 
their Powers were legendary. 


"I helped bring the Roman Empire down," the blond man continued dreamily. 
"They called us barbarians-they just didn't understand! War, Salvatore! There's 
nothing like it. Europe was exciting then. I decided to stick around the countryside 
and enjoy myself. Strange, you know, people never really seemed comfortable 
around me. They used to run or hold up crosses." He shook his head. "But one 
woman came and asked my help. She was a maid in a baron's household, and her 
little mistress was sick. Dying, she said. She wanted me to do something about it. 
And so..." The smile returned and broadened, getting wider and impossibly wider, 
"I did. She was a pretty little thing." 


Stefan had turned his body to hold Elena away from the blond man, and now, for 
a moment, he turned his head away too. He should have known, should have 
guessed. And so it all came back to him. Vickie's death, and Sue's, were ultimately 
to be laid at his door. He had started the chain of events that ended here. 


"Katherine," he said, lifting his head to look at the man. "You're the vampire who 
changed Katherine." 


"To save her life," the blond man said, as if Stefan were stupid at learning a 
lesson. "Which your little sweetheart here took." 


A name. Stefan was searching for a name in his mind, knowing that Katherine had 
told it to him, just as she must have described this man to him once. He could hear 
Katherine's words in his mind: I woke in the middle of the night and I saw the man 


Page 99 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
that Gudren, my maid, had brought. I was frightened. His name was Klaus and 
I'd heard the people in the village say he was evil ... 


"Klaus," the blond man said mildly, as if agreeing with something. "That was what 
she called me, anyway. She came back to me after two little Italian boys jilted her. 
She'd done everything for them, changed them into vampires, given them eternal life, 


. 
but they were ungrateful and threw her out. Very strange." 


but they were ungrateful and threw her out. Very strange." 


"What was even stranger was that she never got over you, Salvatore. You 
especially. She was always drawing unflattering comparisons between us. I tried to 
beat some sense into her, but it never really worked. Maybe I should have just killed 
her myself, I don't know. But by then I'd gotten used to having her around. She 
never was the brightest. But she was good to look at, and she knew how to have fun. 
I showed her that, how to enjoy the killing. Eventually her brain turned a little, but so 
what? It wasn't her brains I was keeping her for." 


There was no longer any vestige of love for Katherine in Stefan's heart, but he 
found he could still hate the man who had made her what she was in the end. 


"Me? Me, sport?" Klaus pointed to his own chest in unbelief. "You made 
Katherine into what she is right now, or rather your little girlfriend did. Right now, 
she's dust. Worm's meat. But your sweetie is just slightly beyond my reach at 
present. Vibrating on a higher plane, isn't that what the mystics say, Elena? Why 
don't you vibrate down here with the rest of us?" 


"If only I could," whispered Elena, lifting her head and looking at him with hatred. 


"Oh, well. Meanwhile I've got your friends. Sue was such a sweet girl, I hear." He 
licked his lips. "And Vickie was delectable. Delicate but full bodied, with a nice 
bouquet. More like a nineteen-year-old than seventeen." 


Stefan lunged one step forward, but Elena caught him. "Stefan, don't! This is his 
territory, and his mental powers are stronger than ours. He controls it." 


"Precisely. This is my territory. Unreality." Klaus grinned his staring psychotic 
grin again. "Where your wildest nightmares come true, free of charge. For instance," 
he said, looking at Stefan, "how'd you like to see what your sweetheart really looks 
like right now? Without her makeup?" 


Elena made a soft sound, almost a moan. Stefan held her tighter. 


"It's been how long since she died? About six months? Do you know what 
happens to a body once it's been in the ground six months?" Klaus licked his lips 
again, like a dog. 


Now Stefan understood. Elena shivered, head bent, and tried to move away from 
him, but he locked his arms around her.

L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
"It's all right," he said to her softly. And to Klaus: "You're forgetting yourself. I'm 
not a human who jumps at shadows and the sight of blood. I know about death, 
Klaus. It doesn't frighten me." 

"No, but does it thrill you?" Klaus's voice dropped, low, intoxicating. "Isn't it 
exciting, the stench, the rot, the fluids of decomposing flesh? Isn't it a kick?" 

"Stefan, let me go. Please." Elena was shaking, pushing at him with her hands, all 
the time keeping her head twisted away so he couldn't see her face. Her voice 
sounded close to tears. "Please." 


"The only Power you have here is the power of illusion," Stefan said to Klaus. He 
held Elena to him, cheek pressed to her hair. He could feel the changes in the body 
he embraced. The hair under his cheek seemed to coarsen and Elena's form to shrink 
on itself. 

"The only Power you have here is the power of illusion," Stefan said to Klaus. He 
held Elena to him, cheek pressed to her hair. He could feel the changes in the body 
he embraced. The hair under his cheek seemed to coarsen and Elena's form to shrink 
on itself. 

"Stefan, I don't want you to look at me-" 

Eyes on Klaus, Stefan gently pushed the coarsened white hair away and stroked 
the side of Elena's face, ignoring the roughness against his fingertips. 

"But of course most of the time it just decomposes. What a way to go. You lose 
everything, skin, flesh, muscles, internal organs-all back into the ground..." 

The body in Stefan's arms was dwindling. He shut his eyes and held tighter, 
hatred for Klaus burning inside him. An illusion, it was all an illusion... 

"Stefan..." It was a dry whisper, faint as the scratch of paper blown down a 
sidewalk. It hung on the air a minute and then vanished, and Stefan found himself 
holding a pile of bones. 

"And finally it ends up like that, in over two hundred separate, easy-to-assemble 
pieces. Comes with its own handy-dandy carrying case..." On the far side of the 
circle of light there was a creaking sound. The white coffin there was opening by 
itself, the lid lifting. "Why don't you do the honors, Salvatore? Go put Elena where 
she belongs." 

Stefan had dropped to his knees, shaking, looking at the slender white bones in 
his hands. It was all an illusion-Klaus was merely controlling Bonnie's trance and 
showing Stefan what he wanted Stefan to see. He hadn't really hurt Elena, but the 
hot, protective fury inside Stefan wouldn't recognize that. Carefully, Stefan laid the 
fragile bones on the ground and touched them once, gently. Then he looked up at 
Klaus, lips curled with contempt.

"That is not Elena," he said. 


"Of course it is. I'd recognize her anywhere." Klaus spread his hands and 
declaimed, " 'I knew a woman, lovely in her bones...' " 


"No." Sweat was beading on Stefan's forehead. He shut out Klaus's voice and 
concentrated, fists clenched, muscles cracking with effort. It was like pushing a 
boulder uphill, fighting Klaus's influence. But where they lay, the delicate bones 
began trembling, and a faint golden light shone around them. 


'' 'A rag and a bone and a hank of hair... the fool he called them his lady fair... 
' " 


The light was shimmering, dancing, linking the bones together. Warm and golden 
it folded about them, clothing them as they rose in the air. What stood there now 
was a featureless form of soft radiance. Sweat ran into Stefan's eyes and he felt as if 
his lungs would burst. 


. 
" 'Clay lies still, but blood's a rover...' " 


" 'Clay lies still, but blood's a rover...' " 


" 'And the crack in the teacup opens a lane to the land of the dead . . .' " 


"No." Dizziness swept over Stefan as he felt the last surge of Power sigh out of 
him. A breath lifted the figure's breast, and eyes blue as lapis lazuli opened. 


Elena smiled, and he felt the blaze of her love arc to meet him. "Stefan." Her head 
was high, proud as any queen's. 


Stefan turned to Klaus, who had stopped speaking and was glaring mutely. 


"This," Stefan said distinctly, "is Elena. Not whatever empty shell she's left 
behind in the ground. This is Elena, and nothing you do can ever touch her." 


He held out his hand, and Elena took it and stepped to him. When they touched, 
he felt a jolt, and then felt her Powers flowing into him, sustaining him. They stood 
together, side by side, facing the blond man. Stefan had never felt as fiercely 
victorious in his life, or as strong. 


Klaus stared at them for perhaps twenty seconds and then went berserk. 


His face twisted in loathing. Stefan could feel waves of malignant Power battering 
against him and Elena, and he used all his strength to resist it. The maelstrom of dark 
fury was trying to tear them apart, howling through the room, destroying everything 
in its path. Candles snuffed out and flew into the air as if caught in a tornado. The 
dream was breaking up around them, shattering. 


Stefan clung to Elena's other hand. The wind blew her hair, whipping it around her 
face. 


02 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
"Stefan!" She was shouting, trying to make herself heard. Then he heard her voice 
in his mind. "Stefan, listen to me! There is one thing you can do to stop him. You 
need a victim, Stefan-find one of his victims. Only a victim will know-" 


The noise level was unbearable, as if the very fabric of space and time was 
tearing. Stefan felt Elena's hands ripped from his. With a cry of desperation, he 
reached out for her again, but he could feel nothing. He was already drained by the 
effort of fighting Klaus, and he couldn't hold on to consciousness. The darkness 
took him spinning down with it. 


Bonnie had seen everything. 


It was strange, but once she stepped aside to let Stefan go to Elena, she seemed 
to lose physical presence in the dream. It was as if she were no longer a player but 
the stage the action was being played upon. She could watch, but she couldn't do 
anything else. 


. 
In the end, she'd been afraid. She wasn't strong enough to hold the dream 
together, and the whole thing finally exploded, throwing her out of the trance, back 
into Stefan's room. 


In the end, she'd been afraid. She wasn't strong enough to hold the dream 
together, and the whole thing finally exploded, throwing her out of the trance, back 
into Stefan's room. 


"Stefan? Are you okay?" 


He looked wildly around the room as if trying to find something. "Elena!" he said, 
and then he stopped, memory clearly returning. 


His face twisted. For one dreadful instant Bonnie thought he was going to cry, but 


he only shut his eyes and dropped his head into his hands. 


"Stefan?" 


"I lost her. I couldn't hold on." 


"I know." Bonnie watched him a moment, then, gathering her courage, knelt in 


front of him, touching his shoulders. "I'm sorry." 
His head lifted abruptly, his green eyes dry but so dilated they looked black. His 


nostrils were flared, his lips drawn back from his teeth. 


"Klaus!" He spat the name as if it were a curse. "Did you see him?" 


"Yes," Bonnie said, pulling back. She gulped, her stomach churning. "He's crazy, 


03 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
isn't he, Stefan?" 
"Yes." Stefan got up. "And he must be stopped." 
"But how?" Since seeing Klaus, Bonnie was more frightened than ever, more 
frightened and less confident. "What could stop him, Stefan? I've never felt anything 


like that Power." 


"But didn't you-?" Stefan turned to her quickly. "Bonnie, didn't you hear what 
Elena said at the end?" 
"No. What do you mean? I couldn't hear anything; there was a slight hurricane 

going on at the time." 
"Bonnie..." Stefan's eyes went distant with speculation and he spoke as if to 


himself. "That means that he probably didn't hear it either. So he doesn't know, and 
he won't try to stop us." 
"From what? Stefan, what are you talking about?" 
"From finding a victim. Listen, Bonnie, Elena told me that if we can find a 
surviving victim of Klaus's, we can find a way to stop him." 
Bonnie was in completely over her head. "But... why?" 
"Because vampires and their donors-their prey-share minds briefly while the 


blood is being exchanged. Sometimes the donor can learn things about the vampire 


that way. Not always, but occasionally. That's what must have happened, and Elena 

knows it." 

knows it." 
She expected Stefan to be deflated, but he wasn't. "A vampire," he said simply. 


"A human Klaus made into a vampire would qualify as a victim. As long as they've 
exchanged blood, they've touched minds." 
"Oh. Oh. So... if we can find a vampire he's made... but where?" 
"Maybe in Europe." Stefan began to pace around the room, his eyes narrowed. 


"Klaus has a long history, and some of his vampires are bound to be there. I may 
have to go and look for one." 


Bonnie was utterly dismayed. "But Stefan, you can't leave us. You can't!" 
Stefan stopped where he was, across the room, and stood very still. Then at last, 
he turned to face her. "I don't want to," he said quietly. "And we'll try to think of 
another solution first-maybe we can get hold of Tyler again. I'll wait a week, until 


04 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
next Saturday. But I may have to leave, Bonnie. You know that as well as I do." 

There was a long, long silence between them. 

Bonnie fought the heat in her eyes, determined to be grown up and mature. She 
wasn't a baby and she would prove that now, once and for all. She caught Stefan's 
gaze and slowly nodded.

June 19, Friday, 11:45 prev.m. Dear Diary,


Oh, God, what are we going to do? 


This has been the longest week of my life. Today was the last day of school and 
tomorrow Stefan is leaving. He's going to Europe to search for a vampire who got 
changed by Klaus. He says he doesn't want to leave us unprotected. But he's 
going to go. 


We can't find Tyler. His car disappeared from the cemetery, but he hasn't 
turned up at school. He's missed every final this week. Not that the rest of us are 
doing much better. I wish Robert E. Lee was like the schools that have all their 
finals before graduation. I don't know whether I'm writing English or Swahili 
these days. 


I hate Klaus. From what I saw he's as crazy as Katherine-and even crueler. 
What he did to Vickie-but I can't even talk about that or I'll start crying again. 
He was just playing with us at Caroline's party, like a cat with a mouse. And to do 
it on Meredith's birthday, too-although I suppose he couldn't have known that. 
He seems to know a lot, though. He doesn't talk like a foreigner, not like Stefan did 
when he first came to America, and he knows all about American things, even 
songs from the fifties. Maybe he's been over here for a while... 


Bonnie stopped writing. She thought desperately. All this time, they had been 
thinking of victims in Europe, of vampires. But from the way Klaus talked, he had 
obviously been in America a long time. He didn't sound foreign at all. And he'd 
chosen to attack the girls on Meredith's birthday... 


Bonnie got up, reached for the telephone, and called Meredith's number. A sleepy 
male voice answered. 


"Mr. Sulez, this is Bonnie. Can I speak to Meredith?" 


"Bonnie! Don't you know what time it is?" 


"Yes." Bonnie thought quickly. "But it's about-about a final we had today. 
Please, I have to talk with her." 


There was a long pause, then a heavy sigh. "Just a minute." 


05 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
Bonnie tapped her fingers impatiently as she waited. At last there was the click of 
another phone being picked up. 


"Bonnie?" came Meredith's voice. "What's wrong?" 
"Nothing. I mean-" Bonnie was excruciatingly conscious of the open line, of the 
fact that Meredith's father hadn't hung up. He might be listening. "It's about-that 
German problem we've been working on. You remember. The one we couldn't figure 
out for the final. You know how we've been looking for the one person who can 


. 
help us solve it? Well, I think I know who it is." 


help us solve it? Well, I think I know who it is." 
"No," Bonnie said, "it doesn't. It hits a lot closer to home, Meredith. A lot. In 
fact, you could say it's right in your own backyard, hanging on your family tree." 


The line was silent so long Bonnie wondered if Meredith was still there. 
"Meredith?" 


"I'm thinking. Does this solution have anything to do with coincidence?" 
"Nope." Bonnie relaxed and smiled slightly, grimly. Meredith had it now. "Not a 
thing to do with coincidence. It's more a case of history repeating itself. Deliberately 
repeating itself, if you see what I mean." 


"Yes," Meredith said. She sounded as if she were recovering from a shock, and 
no wonder. "You know, I think you just may be right. But there's still the matter of 
persuading-this person-to actually help us." 


"You think that may be a problem?" 


"I think it could. Sometimes people get very rattled-about a test. Sometimes 
they even kind of lose their minds." 
Bonnie's heart sank. This was something that hadn't occurred to her. What if he 


couldn't tell them? What if he were that far gone? 


"All we can do is try," she said, making her voice as optimistic as possible. 
"Tomorrow we'll have to try." 
"All right. I'll pick you up at noon. Good night, Bonnie." 
"Night, Meredith." Bonnie added, "I'm sorry." 
"No, I think it may be for the best. So that history doesn't continue to repeat itself 


forever. Good-bye." 
Bonnie pressed the disconnect button on the handset, clicking it off. Then she 


06 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
just sat for a few minutes, her finger on the button, staring at the wall. Finally she 
replaced the handset in its cradle and picked up her diary again. She put a period on 
the last sentence and added a new one. 

We are going to see Meredith's grandfather tomorrow. 

"I'm an idiot," Stefan said in Meredith's car the next day. They were going to 
West Virginia, to the institution where Meredith's grandfather was a patient. It was 
going to be a fairly long drive. 

"We're all idiots. Except Bonnie," Matt said. Even in the midst of her anxiety 
Bonnie felt a warm glow at that. 

But Meredith was shaking her head, eyes on the road. "Stefan, you couldn't have 
realized, so stop beating up on yourself. You didn't know that Klaus attacked 


Caroline's party on the anniversary of the attack on my grandfather. And it didn't 
occur to Matt or me that Klaus could have been in America for so long because we 
never saw Klaus or heard him speak. We were thinking of people he could have 
attacked in Europe. Really, Bonnie was the only one who could have put it all 
together, because she had all the information."

attacked in Europe. Really, Bonnie was the only one who could have put it all 
together, because she had all the information." 

"I won't; modesty is one of my most charming qualities," Bonnie replied. 

Matt snorted, but then he said, "I still think it was pretty smart," which started the 
glow all over again. 

The institution was a terrible place. Bonnie tried as hard as she could to conceal 
her horror and disgust, but she knew Meredith could sense it. Meredith's shoulders 
were stiff with defensive pride as she walked down the halls in front of them. Bonnie, 
who had known her for so many years, could see the humiliation underneath that 
pride. Meredith's parents considered her grandfather's condition such a blot that they 
never allowed him to be mentioned to outsiders. It had been a shadow over the entire 
family. 

And now Meredith was showing that secret to strangers for the first time. Bonnie 
felt a rush of love and admiration for her friend. It was so like Meredith to do it 
without fuss, with dignity, letting nobody see what it cost her. But the institution was 
still terrible. 

It wasn't filthy or filled with raving maniacs or anything like that. The patients 
looked clean and well cared for. But there was something about the sterile hospital 
smells and the halls crowded with motionless wheelchairs and blank eyes that made 
Bonnie want to run. 

07 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
It was like a building full of zombies. Bonnie saw one old woman, her pink scalp 
showing through thin white hair, slumped with her head on the table next to a naked 
plastic doll. When Bonnie reached out desperately, she found Matt's hand already 
reaching for hers. They followed Meredith that way, holding on so hard it hurt. 

"This is his room." 

Inside was another zombie, this one with white hair that still showed an occasional 
fleck of black like Meredith's. His face was a mass of wrinkles and lines, the eyes 
rheumy and rimmed with scarlet. They stared vacantly. 

"Granddad," Meredith said, kneeling in front of his wheelchair, "Granddad, it's 
me, Meredith. I've come to visit you. I've got something important to ask you." 

The old eyes never flickered. 

"Sometimes he knows us," Meredith said quietly, without emotion. "But mostly 
these days he doesn't." 

The old man just went on staring. 


Stefan dropped to his heels. "Let me try," he said. Looking into the wrinkled face 
he began to speak, softly, soothingly, as he had to Vickie. 

Stefan dropped to his heels. "Let me try," he said. Looking into the wrinkled face 
he began to speak, softly, soothingly, as he had to Vickie. 

And no matter what Meredith or Stefan did, that was all the response they could 
elicit. 

Eventually Bonnie tried, using her psychic powers. She could sense something in 
the old man, some spark of life trapped in the imprisoning flesh. But she couldn't 
reach it. 

"I'm sorry," she said, sitting back and pushing hair out of her eyes. "It's no use. I 
can't do anything." 

"Maybe we can come another time," Matt said, but Bonnie knew it wasn't true. 
Stefan was leaving tomorrow; there would never be another time. And it had seemed 
like such a good idea... The glow that had warmed her earlier was ashes now, and 
her heart felt like a lump of lead. She turned away to see Stefan already starting out 
of the room. 

Matt put a hand under her elbow to help her up and guide her out. And after 
standing for a minute with her head bent in discouragement, Bonnie let him. It was 
hard to summon up enough energy to put one foot in front of the other. She glanced 
back dully to see whether Meredith was following-

And screamed. Meredith was standing in the center of the room, facing the door, 

08 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
discouragement written on her face. But behind her, the figure in the wheelchair had 
stirred at last. In a silent explosion of movement, it had reared above her, the rheumy 
old eyes open wide and the mouth open wider. Meredith's grandfather looked as if 
he had been caught in the act of leaping-arms flung out, mouth forming a silent 
howl. Bonnie's screams rang from the rafters. 

Everything happened at once then. Stefan came charging back in, Meredith spun 
around, Matt grabbed for her. But the old figure didn't leap. He stood towering 
above all of them, staring over their heads, seeming to see something none of them 
could. Sounds were coming from his mouth at last, sounds that formed one ululating 
word. 

"Vampire! Vampiire!" 

Attendants were in the room, crowding Bonnie and the others away, restraining 
the old man. Their shouts added to the pandemonium. 

"Vampire! Vampire!" Meredith's grandfather caterwauled, as if warning the town. 
Bonnie felt panicked-was he looking at Stefan? Was it an accusation? 

"Please, you'll have to leave now. I'm sorry, but you'll have to go," a nurse was 
saying. They were being whisked out. Meredith fought as she was forced out into 
the hall. 


"Granddaddy-!" 

"Granddaddy-!" 

And then: "White ash wood! Vampire! White ash wood-" 

The door slammed shut. 

Meredith gasped, fighting tears. Bonnie had her nails dug into Matt's arm. Stefan 
turned to them, green eyes wide with shock. 

"I said, you'll have to leave now," the harassed nurse was repeating impatiently. 
The four of them ignored her. They were all looking at each other, stunned 
confusion giving way to realization in their faces. 

"Tyler said there was only one kind of wood that could hurt him-" Matt began. 

"White ash wood," said Stefan. 

"We'll have to find out where he's hiding," Stefan said on the way home. He was 
driving, since Meredith had dropped the keys at the car door. "That's the first thing. 
If we rush this, we could warn him off." 

His green eyes were shining with a queer mixture of triumph and grim 
determination, and he spoke in a clipped and rapid voice. They were all on the 
ragged edge, Bonnie thought, as if they'd been gulping uppers all night. Their nerves 

09 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
were frayed so thin that anything could happen. 


She had a sense, too, of impending cataclysm. As if everything were coming to a 
head, all the events since Meredith's birthday party gathering to a conclusion. 


Tonight, she thought. Tonight it all happens. It seemed strangely appropriate that 
it should be the eve of the solstice. 


"The eve of what?" Matt said. 


She hadn't even realized she'd spoken aloud. "The eve of the solstice," she said. 
"That's what today is. The day before the summer solstice." 


"Don't tell me. Druids, right?" 


"They celebrated it," Bonnie confirmed. "It's a day for magic, for marking the 
change of the seasons. And..." she hesitated. "Well, it's like all other feast days, like 
Halloween or the winter solstice. A day when the line between the visible world and 
the invisible world is thin. When you can see ghosts, they used to say. When things 
happen." 


"Things," Stefan said, turning onto the main highway that headed back toward 
Fell's Church, "are going to happen." 


None of them realized how soon. 


Mrs. Flowers was in the back garden. They had driven straight to the boarding 
house to look for her. She was pruning rosebushes, and the smell of summer 


. 
surrounded her. 


surrounded her. 


"Slow down, slow down now," she said, peering at them from under the brim of 
her straw hat. "What is it you want? White ash? There's one just down beyond those 
oak trees in back. Now, wait a minute-" she added as they all scrambled off again. 


Stefan ringed a branch of the tree with a jack-knife Matt produced from his 
pocket. I wonder when he started carrying that? Bonnie thought. She also wondered 
what Mrs. Flowers thought of them as they came back, the two boys carrying the 
leafy six-foot bough between them on their shoulders. 


But Mrs. Flowers just looked without saying anything. As they neared the house, 
though, she called after them, "A package came for you, boy." 


Stefan turned his head, the branch still on his shoulder. "For me?" 


"It had your name on it. A package and a letter. I found them on the front porch 
this afternoon. I put them upstairs in your room." 


10 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
Bonnie looked at Meredith, then at Matt and Stefan, meeting their bewildered, 
suspicious gazes in turn. The anticipation in the air heightened suddenly, almost 
unbearably. 

"But who could it be from? Who could even know you're here-" she began as 
they climbed the stairs to the attic. And then she stopped, dread fluttering between 
her ribs. Premonition was buzzing around inside her like a nagging fly, but she 
pushed it away. Not now, she thought, not now. 

But there was no way to keep from seeing the package on Stefan's desk. The 
boys propped the white ash branch against the wall and went to look at it, a longish, 
flattish parcel wrapped in brown paper, with a creamy envelope on top. 

On the front, in familiar crazy handwriting, was scrawled Stefan. 

The handwriting from the mirror. 

They all stood staring down at the package as if it were a scorpion. 

"Watch out," Meredith said as Stefan slowly reached for it. Bonnie knew what 
she meant. She felt as if the whole thing might explode or belch poisonous gas or 
turn into something with teeth and claws. 

The envelope Stefan picked up was square and sturdy, made of good paper with 
a fine finish. Like a prince's invitation to the ball, Bonnie thought. But incongruously, 
there were several dirty fingerprints on the surface and the edges were grimy. Well-
Klaus hadn't looked any too clean in the dream. 

Stefan glanced at front and back and then tore the envelope open. He pulled out a 
single piece of heavy stationery. The other three crowded around, looking over his 
shoulder as he unfolded it. Then Matt gave an exclamation. 

"What the... it's blank!" 


It was. On both sides. Stefan turned it over and examined each. His face was 
tense, shuttered. Everyone else relaxed, though, making noises of disgust. A stupid 
practical joke. Meredith had reached for the package, which looked flat enough to be 
empty as well, when Stefan suddenly stiffened, his breath hissing in. Bonnie glanced 
quickly over and jumped. Meredith's hand froze on the package, and Matt swore.

Stefan-

Shall we try to solve this like gentlemen? I have the girl. Come to the old 
farmhouse in the woods after dark and we'll talk, just the two of us. Come alone 

11 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
and I'll let her go. Bring anyone else and she dies. 

There was no signature, but at the bottom the words appeared This is between 
you and me. 

"What girl?" Matt was demanding, looking from Bonnie to Meredith as if to make 
sure they were still there. "What girl?" 

With a sharp motion, Meredith's elegant fingers tore the package open and pulled 
out what was inside. A pale green scarf with a pattern of vines and leaves. Bonnie 
remembered it perfectly, and a vision came to her in a rush. Confetti and birthday 
presents, orchids and chocolate. 

"Caroline," she whispered, and shut her eyes. 

These last two weeks had been so strange, so different from ordinary high school 
life, that she had almost forgotten Caroline existed. Caroline had gone off to an 
apartment in another town to escape, to be safe-but Meredith had said it to her in 
the beginning. He can follow you to Heron, I'm sure. 

"He was just playing with us again," Bonnie murmured. "He let us get this far, 
even going to see your grandfather, Meredith, and then..." 

"He must have known," Meredith agreed. "He must have known all along we were 
looking for a victim. And now he's checkmated us. Unless-" Her dark eyes lit with 
sudden hope. "Bonnie, you don't think Caroline could have dropped this scarf the 
night of the party? And that he just picked it up?" 

"No." The premonition was buzzing closer and Bonnie swatted at it, trying to 
keep it away. She didn't want it, didn't want to know. But she felt certain of one 
thing: this wasn't a bluff. Klaus had Caroline. 

"What are we going to do?" she said softly. 

"I know what we're not going to do, and that's listen to him," Matt said. " 'Try to 
solve it like gentlemen'-he's scum, not a gentleman. It's a trap." 

"Of course it's a trap," Meredith said impatiently. "He waited until we found out 
how to hurt him and now he's trying to separate us. But it won't work!" 


Bonnie had been watching Stefan's face with growing dismay. Because while Matt 
and Meredith were indignantly talking, he had been quietly folding up the letter and 
putting it back in its envelope. Now he stood gazing down at it, his face still, 
untouched by anything that was going on around him. And the look in his green eyes 
scared Bonnie.

12 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
scared Bonnie. 


"I think," said Stefan carefully, concentrating on each word, "that I am going out 
to the woods after dark." 
Matt nodded, and like the quarterback he was, began to chart out a plan. "Okay, 


you go distract him. And meanwhile, the three of us-" 


"The three of you," Stefan continued just as deliberately, looking right at him, "are 
going home. To bed." 
There was a pause that seemed endless to Bonnie's taut nerves. The others just 


stared at Stefan. 


At last Meredith said lightly, "Well, it's going to be hard to catch him while we're 
in bed unless he's kind enough to come visiting." 
That broke the tension and Matt said, drawing a long-suffering breath, "All right, 


Stefan, I understand how you feel about this-" But Stefan interrupted. 


"I'm dead serious, Matt. Klaus is right; this is between him and me. And he says 
to come alone or he'll hurt Caroline. So I'm going alone. It's my decision." 
"It's your funeral," Bonnie blurted out, almost hysterically. "Stefan, you're crazy. 


You can't." 
"Watch me." 
"We won't let you-" 
"Do you think," Stefan said, looking at her, "that you could stop me if you tried?" 
This silence was acutely uncomfortable. Staring at him, Bonnie felt as if Stefan 


had changed somehow before her eyes. His face seemed sharper, his posture 
different, as if to remind her of the lithe, hard predator's muscles under his clothes. 
All at once he seemed distant, alien. Frightening. 

Bonnie looked away. 

"Let's be reasonable about this," Matt was saying, changing tactics. "Let's just 
stay calm and talk this over-" 
"There's nothing to talk over. I'm going. You're not." 
"You owe us more than that, Stefan," Meredith said, and Bonnie felt grateful for 


her cool voice. "Okay, so you can tear us all limb from limb; fine, no argument. We 
get the point. But after all we've been through together, we deserve more of a 
thorough discussion before you go running off." 

"You said it was the girls' fight too," Matt added. "When did you decide it 

13 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
. 
wasn't?" 


wasn't?" 


"No, it isn't!" Bonnie cried. "Did you make Elena kill Katherine?" 


"I made Katherine go back to Klaus! That's how this got started. And I got 
Caroline involved; if it wasn't for me, she would never have hated Elena, never have 
gotten in with Tyler. I have a responsibility toward her." 


"You just want to believe that," Bonnie almost yelled. "Klaus hates all of us! Do 
you really think he's going to let you walk out of there? Do you think he plans to 
leave the rest of us alone?" 


"No," Stefan said, and picked up the branch leaning against the wall. He took 
Matt's knife out of his own pocket and began to strip the twigs off, making it into a 
straight white spear. 


"Oh, great, you're going off for single combat!" Matt said, furious. "Don't you 
see how stupid that is? You're walking right into his trap!" He advanced a step on 
Stefan. "You may not think that the three of us can stop you-" 


"No, Matt." Meredith's low, level voice cut across the room. "It won't do any 
good." Stefan looked at her, the muscles around his eyes hardening, but she just 
looked back, her face set and calm. "So you're determined to meet Klaus face to 
face, Stefan. All right. But before you go, at least be sure you have a fighting 
chance." Coolly, she began to unbutton the neck of her tailored blouse. 


Bonnie felt a jolt, even though she'd offered the same thing only a week earlier. 
But that had been in private, for God's sake, she thought. Then she shrugged. Public 
or private, what difference did it make? 


She looked at Matt, whose face reflected his consternation. Then she saw Matt's 
brow crease and the beginning of that stubborn, bullheaded expression that used to 
terrify the coaches of op-posing football teams. His blue eyes turned to hers and she 
nodded, thrusting out her chin. Without a word, she unzipped the light wind-breaker 
she was wearing and Matt pulled off his T-shirt. 


Stefan stared from one to another of the three people grimly disrobing in his 
room, trying to conceal his own shock. But he shook his head, the white spear in 
front of him like a weapon. "No." 


"Don't be a jerk, Stefan," Matt snapped. Even in the confusion of this terrible 
moment something inside Bonnie paused to admire his bare chest. "There's three of 
us. You should be able to take plenty without hurting any one of us." 


"I said, no! Not for revenge, and not to fight evil with evil! Not for any reason. I 
thought you would understand that." Stefan's look at Matt was bitter. 


"I understand that you're going to die out there!" Matt shouted.

"He's right!" Bonnie pressed her knuckles against her lips. The premonition was 
getting through her defenses. She didn't want to let it in, but she didn't have the 


strength to resist anymore. With a shudder, she felt it stab through and heard the 
words in her mind. 

strength to resist anymore. With a shudder, she felt it stab through and heard the 
words in her mind. 

For a moment, just a moment, she thought he might listen to her. Then his face 
went hard again and he spoke coldly. 

"It isn't your problem. Let me worry about it." 

"But if there's no way to win-" Matt began. 

"That isn't what Bonnie said!" Stefan replied tersely. 

"Yes, it is! What the hell are you talking about?" Matt shouted. It was hard to 
make Matt lose his temper, but once lost it wasn't easily gotten back. "Stefan, I've 
had enough-" 

"And so have I!" Stefan shot back in a roar. In a tone Bonnie had never heard him 
use before. "I'm sick of you all, sick of your bickering and your spinelessness-and 
your premonitions, too! This is my problem." 

"I thought we were a team-" Matt cried. 

"We are not a team. You are a bunch of stupid humans! Even with everything 
that's happened to you, deep down you just want to live your safe little lives in your 
safe little houses until you go to your safe little graves! I'm nothing like you and I 
don't want to be! I've put up with you this long because I had to, but this is the end." 
He looked at each of them and spoke deliberately, emphasizing each word. "I don't 
need any of you. I don't want you with me, and I don't want you following me. 
You'll only spoil my strategy. Anyone who does follow me, I'll kill." 

And with one last smoldering glance, he turned on his heel and walked out.

"He's gone round the bend," Matt said, staring at the empty doorway through 
which Stefan had disappeared. 

"No, he hasn't," said Meredith. Her voice was rueful and quiet, but there was a 
kind of helpless laugh in it too. "Don't you see what he's doing, Matt?" she said 
when he turned to her. "Yelling at us, making us hate him to try and chase us away. 
Being as nasty as possible so we'll stay mad and let him do this alone." She glanced 

15 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
at the doorway and raised her eyebrows. " 'Anyone who does follow me, I'll kill' 
was going a bit overboard, though." 


Bonnie giggled suddenly, wildly, in spite of herself. "I think he borrowed it from 
Damon. 'Get this straight, I don't need any of you!' " 


" 'You bunch of stupid humans,' " Matt added. 


"But I still don't understand. You just had a premonition, Bonnie, and Stefan 
doesn't usually discount those. If there's no way to fight and win, what's the point of 
going?" 


"Bonnie didn't say there was no way to fight and win. She said there was no way 
to fight and survive. Right, Bonnie?" Meredith looked at her. 


The fit of giggles dissolved away. Startled herself, Bonnie tried to examine the 
premonition, but she knew no more than the words that had sprung into her mind. 
No one can fight him and live. 


"You mean Stefan thinks-" Slow, thunderous outrage was smoldering in Matt's 
eyes. "He thinks he's going to go and stop Klaus even though he gets killed himself? 
Like some sacrificial lamb?" 


"More like Elena," Meredith said soberly. "And maybe-so he can be with her." 


"Huh-uh." Bonnie shook her head. She might not know more about the prophecy, 
but this she knew. "He doesn't think that, I'm sure. Elena's special. She is what she is 
because she died too young; she left so much unfinished in her own life, and-well, 
she's a special case. But Stefan's been a vampire for five hundred years, and he 
certainly wouldn't be dying young. There's no guarantee he'd end up with Elena. He 
might go to another place or-or just go out. And he knows that. I'm sure he knows 
that. I think he's just keeping his promise to her, to stop Klaus no matter what it 
costs." 


"To try, at least," Matt said softly, and it sounded as if he were quoting. "Even if 
you know you're going to lose." He looked up at the girls suddenly. "I'm going after 
him." 


"Of course," said Meredith patiently. 


Matt hesitated. "Uh-I don't suppose I could convince you two to stay here?" 


"After all that inspiring talk about teamwork? Not a chance." 


. 
"I was afraid of that. So..." 


"I was afraid of that. So..." 


They gathered what weapons they could. Matt's pocketknife that Stefan had 
dropped, the ivory-hilted dagger from Stefan's dresser, a carving knife from the 


16 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
kitchen. 

Outside, there was no sign of Mrs. Flowers. The sky was pale purple, shading to 
apricot in the west. Twilight of the solstice eve, Bonnie thought, and hairs on her 
arms tried to lift. 

"Klaus said the old farmhouse in the woods-that must mean the Francher 
place," Matt said. "Where Katherine dumped Stefan in the abandoned well." 

"That makes sense. He's probably been using Katherine's tunnel to get back and 
forth under the river," Meredith said. "Unless Old Ones are so powerful they can 
cross running water without harming themselves." 

That's right, Bonnie remembered, evil things couldn't cross running water, and the 
more evil you were, the harder it was. "But we don't know anything about the 
Originals," she said aloud. 

"No, and that means we've got to be careful," Matt said. "I know these woods 
pretty well, and I know the path Stefan will probably use. I think we should take a 
different one." 

"So Stefan won't see us and kill us?" 

"So Klaus won't see us, or not all of us. So maybe we'll have a chance of getting 
to Caroline. Somehow or other we've got to get Caroline out of the equation; as long 
as Klaus can threaten to hurt her he can make Stefan do anything he wants. And it's 
always best to plan ahead, to get a jump on the enemy. Klaus said meet there after 
dark; well, we'll be there before dark and maybe we can surprise him." 

Bonnie was deeply impressed by this strategy. No wonder he's a quarterback, she 
was thinking. I would have just rushed in, yelling. 

Matt picked out an almost invisible path between the oak trees. The undergrowth 
was especially lush this time of year, with mosses, grasses, flowering plants, and 
ferns. Bonnie had to trust that Matt knew where he was going, because she certainly 
didn't. Above, birds were giving one last burst of song before seeking out a roost 
for the night. 

It got dimmer. Moths and lacewings fluttered past Bonnie's face. After stumbling 
through a patch of toadstools covered with feeding slugs, she was intensely grateful 
that this time she'd worn jeans. 

At last Matt stopped them. "We're getting close," he said, his voice low. "There's 
a sort of bluff where we can look down and Klaus might not see us. Be quiet and 
careful." 

Bonnie had never taken so much trouble placing her feet before. Fortunately the 


leaf litter was wet and not crackly. After a few minutes Matt dropped to his stomach 
and gestured for them to follow. Bonnie kept telling herself, fiercely, that she didn't 

17 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
mind the centipedes and earthworms her sliding fingers dug up, that she had no 
feelings one way or another about cobwebs in the face. This was life and death, and 
she was competent. No dweeb, no baby, but competent.

and gestured for them to follow. Bonnie kept telling herself, fiercely, that she didn't 
mind the centipedes and earthworms her sliding fingers dug up, that she had no 
feelings one way or another about cobwebs in the face. This was life and death, and 
she was competent. No dweeb, no baby, but competent. 

They were gazing down on the Francher homestead-or what was left of it. It had 
crumbled into the earth long ago, taken back by the forest. Now it was only a 
foundation, building stones covered with flowering weeds and prickly brambles, and 
one tall chimney like a lonely monument. 

"There she is. Caroline," Meredith breathed in Bonnie's other ear. 

Caroline was a dim figure sitting against the chimney. Her pale green dress 
showed up in the gathering dark, but her auburn hair just looked black. Something 
white shone across her face, and after a moment Bonnie realized it was a gag. Tape 
or a bandage. From her strange posture-arms behind her, legs stretched straight 
out in front-Bonnie also guessed she was tied. 

Poor Caroline, she thought, forgiving the other girl all the nasty, petty, selfish 
things she'd ever done, which was a pretty considerable amount when you got down 
to it. But Bonnie couldn't imagine anything worse than being abducted by a psycho 
vampire who'd already killed two of your classmates, dragged out here to the woods 
and bound, and then left to wait, with your life depending on another vampire who 
had fairly good reason to hate you. After all, Caroline had wanted Stefan in the 
beginning, and had hated and tried to humiliate Elena for getting him. Stefan 
Salvatore was the last person who should feel kindly toward Caroline Forbes. 

"Look!" said Matt. "Is that him? Klaus?" 

Bonnie had seen it too, a ripple of movement on the opposite side of the chimney. 
As she strained her eyes he appeared, his light tan raincoat flapping ghostlike around 
his legs. He glanced down at Caroline and she shrank from him, trying to lean away. 
His laughter sounded so clearly in the quiet air that Bonnie flinched. 

"That's him," she whispered, dropping down behind the screening ferns. "But 
where's Stefan? It's almost dark now." 

"Maybe he got smart and decided not to come," said Matt. 

"No such luck," said Meredith. She was looking through the ferns to the south. 
Bonnie glanced that way herself and started. 

Stefan was standing at the edge of the clearing, having materialized there as if out 
of thin air. Not even Klaus had seen him coming, Bonnie thought. He stood silently, 
making no attempt to hide himself or the white ash spear he was carrying. There was 
something in his stance and the way he looked over the scene before him that made 

18 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
Bonnie remember that in the fifteenth century he'd been an aristocrat, a member of 
the nobility. He said nothing, waiting for Klaus to notice him, refusing to be rushed. 


When Klaus did turn south he went still, and Bonnie got the feeling he was 
surprised Stefan had sneaked up on him. But then he laughed and spread his arms. 

When Klaus did turn south he went still, and Bonnie got the feeling he was 
surprised Stefan had sneaked up on him. But then he laughed and spread his arms. 

Slowly, Stefan looked Klaus up and down, from the tails of his tattered raincoat 
to the top of his windblown head. What Stefan said was: 

"You asked for me. I'm here. Let the girl go." 

"Did I say that?" Looking genuinely surprised, Klaus pressed two hands to his 
chest. Then he shook his head, chuckling. "I don't think so. Let's talk first." 

Stefan nodded, as if Klaus had confirmed something bitter he'd been expecting. 
He took the spear from his shoulder and held it in front of him, handling the 
unwieldy length of wood deftly, easily. "I'm listening," he said. 

"Not as dumb as he looks," Matt murmured from behind the ferns, a note of 
respect in his voice. "And he's not as anxious to get killed as I thought," Matt added. 
"He's being careful." 

Klaus gestured toward Caroline, the tips of his fingers brushing her auburn hair. 
"Why don't you come here so we don't have to shout?" But he didn't threaten to 
hurt his prisoner, Bonnie noticed. 

"I can hear you just fine," Stefan replied. 

"Good," Matt whispered. "That's it, Stefan!" 

Bonnie, though, was studying Caroline. The captive girl was struggling, tossing 
her head back and forth as if she were frantic or in pain. But Bonnie got a strange 
feeling about Caroline's movements, especially those violent jerks of the head, as if 
the girl was straining to reach the sky. The sky... Bonnie's gaze lifted up to it, where 
full darkness had fallen and a waning moon shone over the trees. That was why she 
could see that Caroline's hair was auburn now: the moonlight, she thought. Then, 
with a shock, her eyes dropped to the tree just above Stefan, whose branches were 
rustling slightly in the absence of any wind. "Matt?" she whispered, alarmed. 

Stefan was focused on Klaus, every sense, every muscle, every atom of his 
Power honed and turned toward the Old One before him. But in that tree directly 
above him... 

All thoughts of strategy, of asking Matt what to do, fled from Bonnie's mind. She 
bolted up from her place of concealment and shouted. 

"Stefan! Above you! It's a trap!" 

19 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
Stefan leaped aside, neat as a cat, just as something plunged down on the exact 
place he'd been standing an instant before. The moon lit the scene perfectly, enough 
for Bonnie to see the white of Tyler's bared teeth. 

And to see the white flash of Klaus's eyes as he whirled on her. For one stunned 
instant she stared at him, and then lightning crackled. 

From an empty sky. 


It was only later that Bonnie would realize the strangeness-the fearsomeness-of 
this. At the time she scarcely noted that the sky was clear and star swept and that the 
jagged blue bolt that forked down struck the palm of Klaus's upraised hand. The 
next sight she saw was so terrifying as to black everything else out: Klaus folding his 
hand over that lightning, gathering it somehow, and throwing it at her.

next sight she saw was so terrifying as to black everything else out: Klaus folding his 
hand over that lightning, gathering it somehow, and throwing it at her. 

"Stay here! Right here!" he shouted, and bounded away. 

Those dreaded words. They catapulted Bonnie right up, and she was running 
after him before she knew what she was doing. 

And then the world turned into chaos. 

Klaus had whirled back on Stefan, who was grappling with Tyler, beating him. 
Tyler, in his wolf form, was making terrible sounds as Stefan threw him to the 
ground. 

Meredith was running toward Caroline, approaching from behind the chimney so 
Klaus wouldn't spot her. Bonnie saw her reach Caroline and saw the flash of Stefan's 
silver dagger as Meredith cut the cords around Caroline's wrists. Then Meredith was 
half carrying, half dragging Caroline behind the chimney to work on her feet. 

A sound like antlers clashing made Bonnie spin around. Klaus had come at Stefan 
with a tall branch of his own-it must have been lying flat on the ground before. It 
looked just as sharp as Stefan's, making it a serviceable lance. But Klaus and Stefan 
weren't just stabbing at each other; they were using the sticks as quarterstaffs. Robin 
Hood, Bonnie thought dazedly. Little John and Robin. That was what it looked like: 
Klaus was that much taller and heavier boned than Stefan. 

Then Bonnie saw something else and cried out wordlessly. Behind Stefan, Tyler 
had gotten up again and was crouching, just as he had in the graveyard before 
lunging for Stefan's throat. Stefan's back was to him. And Bonnie couldn't warn him 
in time. 

20 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
But she'd forgotten about Matt. Head down, ignoring claws and fangs, he was 
charging at Tyler, tackling him like a first-rate linebacker before he could leap. Tyler 
went flying sideways, with Matt on top of him. 

Bonnie was overwhelmed. So much was happening. Meredith was sawing through 
Caroline's ankle cords; Matt was pummeling Tyler in a way that certainly would have 
gotten him disqualified on the football field; Stefan was whirling that white ash staff 
as if he'd been trained for it. Klaus was laughing deliriously, seeming exhilarated by 
the exercise, as they traded blows with deadly speed and accuracy. 

But Matt seemed to be in trouble now. Tyler was gripping him and snarling, trying 
to get a hold on his throat. Wildly, Bonnie looked around for a weapon, entirely 


forgetting the carving knife in her pocket. Her eye fell on a dead oak branch. She 
picked it up and ran to where Tyler and Matt were struggling. 

forgetting the carving knife in her pocket. Her eye fell on a dead oak branch. She 
picked it up and ran to where Tyler and Matt were struggling. 

Then Matt was on top of Tyler again, holding Tyler's head down, holding himself 
clear. Bonnie saw her chance and aimed the stick. But Tyler saw her. With a burst of 
supernatural strength, he gathered his legs and sent Matt soaring off him backward. 
Matt's head struck a tree with a sound Bonnie would never forget. The dull sound of 
a rotten melon bursting. He slid down the front of the tree and was still. 

Bonnie was gasping, stunned. She might have started toward Matt, but Tyler was 
there in front of her, breathing hard, bloody saliva running down his chin. He looked 
even more like an animal than he had in the graveyard. As if in a dream, Bonnie 
raised her stick, but she could feel it shaking in her hands. Matt was so still-was he 
breathing? Bonnie could hear the sob in her own breath as she faced Tyler. This was 
ridiculous; this was a boy from her own school. A boy she'd danced with last year at 
the Junior Prom. How could he be keeping her away from Matt, how could he be 
trying to hurt them all? How could he be doing this? 

"Tyler, please-" she began, meaning to reason with him, to beg him... 

"All alone in the woods, little girl?" he said, and his voice was a thick and guttural 
growl, shaped at the last minute into words. In that instant Bonnie knew that this was 
not the boy she'd gone to school with. This was an animal. Oh, God, he's ugly, she 
thought. Ropes of red spit hung out of his mouth. And those yellow eyes with the 
slitted pupils-in them she saw the cruelty of the shark, and the crocodile, and the 
wasp that lays its eggs in a caterpillar's living body. All the cruelty of animal nature in 
those two yellow eyes. 

"Somebody should have warned you," Tyler said, dropping his jaw to laugh the 
way a dog does. "Because if you go out in the woods alone, you might meet the Big 
Bad-" 

"Jerk!" a voice finished for him, and with a feeling of gratitude that bordered on 
the religious, Bonnie saw Meredith beside her. Meredith, holding Stefan's dagger, 

21 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
which shone liquidly in the moonlight. 


"Silver, Tyler," Meredith said, brandishing it. "I wonder what silver does to a 
werewolf's members? Want to see?" All Meredith's elegance, her standoffishness, 
her cool observer's dispassion were gone. This was the essential Meredith, a warrior 
Meredith, and although she was smiling, she was mad. 


"Yes!" shouted Bonnie gleefully, feeling power rush through her. Suddenly she 
could move. She and Meredith, together, were strong. Meredith was stalking Tyler 
from one side, Bonnie held her stick ready on the other. A longing she'd never felt 
before shot through her, the longing to hit Tyler so hard his head would come flying 
off. She could feel the strength to do it surging in her arm. 


And Tyler, with his animal instinct, could sense it, could sense it from both of 
them, closing in on either side. He recoiled, caught himself, and turned to try and get 


. 
away from them. They turned too. In a minute they were all three orbiting like a mini 
solar system: Tyler turning around and around in the middle; Bonnie and Meredith 
circling him, looking for a chance to attack. 


away from them. They turned too. In a minute they were all three orbiting like a mini 
solar system: Tyler turning around and around in the middle; Bonnie and Meredith 
circling him, looking for a chance to attack. 


"I did it! Yes. All right! Yes!" Bonnie shouted, flinging the stick away. Triumph 
erupted from her in a primal shout. "We did it!" She grabbed the heavy body by the 
back of the mane and pulled it off Meredith, where it had fallen. "We-" 


Then she broke off, her words freezing in her throat. "Meredith!" she cried. 


"It's all right," Meredith gasped, her voice tight with pain. And weakness, Bonnie 
thought, chilled as if doused with ice water. Tyler had clawed her leg to the bone. 
There were huge, gaping wounds in the thigh of Meredith's jeans and in the white 
skin that showed clearly through the torn cloth. And to Bonnie's absolute horror, she 
could see inside the skin too, could see flesh and muscle ripped and red blood 
pouring out. 


"Meredith-" she cried frantically. They had to get Meredith to a doctor. 
Everyone had to stop now; everyone must understand that. They had an injury here; 
they needed to get an ambulance, to call 911. "Meredith," she gasped, almost 
weeping. 


"Tie it up with something." Meredith's face was white. Shock. Going into shock. 
And so much blood; so much blood coming out. Oh, God, thought Bonnie, please 
help me. She looked for something to tie it up with, but there was nothing. 


Something dropped on the ground beside her. A length of nylon cord like the 
cord they'd used to tie up Tyler, with frayed edges. Bonnie looked up. 


"Can you use that?" asked Caroline uncertainly, her teeth chattering. 


22 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
She was wearing the green dress, her auburn hair straggling and stuck to her face 
with sweat and blood. Even as she spoke she swayed, and fell to her knees beside 
Meredith. 

"Are you hurt?" Bonnie gasped. 

Caroline shook her head, but then she bent forward, racked with nausea, and 
Bonnie saw the marks in her throat. But there was no time to worry about Caroline 
now. Meredith was more important. 

Bonnie tied the cord above Meredith's wounds, her mind running desperately over 
things she'd learned from her sister Mary. Mary was a nurse. Mary said-a 
tourniquet couldn't be too tight or left on too long or gangrene set in. But she had to 
stop the gushing blood. Oh, Meredith. 


"Bonnie-help Stefan," Meredith was gasping, her voice almost a whisper. "He's 
going to need it..." She sagged backward, her breathing stertorous, her slitted eyes 
looking up at the sky. 

"Bonnie-help Stefan," Meredith was gasping, her voice almost a whisper. "He's 
going to need it..." She sagged backward, her breathing stertorous, her slitted eyes 
looking up at the sky. 

Dazed, she turned to Caroline, who was shivering and retching, sweat beading her 
face. Useless, Bonnie thought. But she had no other choice. 

"Caroline, listen to me," she said. She picked up the largest piece of the stick 
she'd used on Tyler and put it into Caroline's hands. "You stay with Matt and 
Meredith. Loosen that tourniquet every twenty minutes or so. And if Tyler starts to 
wake up, if he even twitches, you hit him as hard as you can with this. Understand? 
Caroline," she added, "this is your big chance to prove you're good for something. 
That you're not useless. All right?" She caught the furtive green eyes and repeated, 
"All right?" 

"But what are you going to do?" 

Bonnie looked toward the clearing. 

"No, Bonnie." Caroline's hand grasped her, and Bonnie noted with some part of 
her mind the broken nails, the rope burns on the wrists. "Stay here where it's safe. 
Don't go to them. There's nothing you can do-" 

Bonnie shook her off and made for the clearing before she lost her resolve. In her 
heart, she knew Caroline was right. There was nothing she could do. But something 
Matt had said before they left was ringing in her mind. To try at least. She had to try. 

Still, in those next few horrible minutes all she could do was look. 

So far, Stefan and Klaus had been trading blows with such violence and accuracy 

23 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
that it had been like a beautiful, lethal dance. But it had been an equal, or almost 
equal, match. Stefan had been holding his own. 


Now she saw Stefan bearing down with his white ash lance, pressing Klaus to his 
knees, forcing him backward, farther and farther back, like a limbo dancer seeing 
how low he could go. And Bonnie could see Klaus's face now, mouth slightly open, 
staring up at Stefan with what looked like astonishment and fear. 


Then everything changed. 


At the very bottom of his descent, when Klaus had bent back as far as he could 
go, when it seemed that he must be about to collapse or break, something happened. 


Klaus smiled. 


And then he started pushing back. 


Bonnie saw Stefan's muscles knot, saw his arms go rigid, trying to resist. But 
Klaus, still grinning madly, eyes wide open, just kept coming. He unfolded like some 
terrible jack-in-the-box, only slowly. Slowly. Inexorably. His grin getting wider until it 
looked as if it would split his face. Like the Cheshire cat. 


. 
A cat, thought Bonnie. 


A cat, thought Bonnie. 


Now Stefan was the one grunting and straining, teeth clenched, trying to hold 
Klaus off. But Klaus and his stick bore down, forcing Stefan backward, forcing him 
to the ground. 


Grinning all the time. 


Until Stefan was lying on his back, his own stick pressing into his throat with the 
weight of Klaus's lance across it. Klaus looked down at him and beamed. "I'm tired 
of playing, little boy," he said, and he straightened and threw his own stick down. 
"Now it's dying time." 


He took Stefan's staff away from him as easily as if he were taking it from a child. 
Picked it up with a flick of his wrist and broke it over his knee, showing how strong 
he was, how strong he had always been. How cruelly he had been playing with 
Stefan. 


One of the halves of the white ash stick he tossed over his shoulder across the 
clearing. The other he jabbed at Stefan. Using not the pointed end but the splintered 
one, broken into a dozen tiny points. He jabbed down with a force that seemed 
almost casual, but Stefan screamed. He did it again and again, eliciting a scream each 
time. 


Bonnie cried out, soundlessly. 


24 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
She had never heard Stefan scream before. She didn't need to be told what kind 
of pain must have caused it. She didn't need to be told that white ash might be the 
only wood deadly to Klaus, but that any wood was deadly to Stefan. That Stefan 
was, if not dying now, about to die. That Klaus, with his hand now raised, was going 
to finish it with one more plunging blow. Klaus's face was tilted to the moon in a grin 
of obscene pleasure, showing that this was what he liked, where he got his thrills. 
From killing. 


And Bonnie couldn't move, couldn't even cry. The world swam around her. It 
had all been a mistake, she wasn't competent; she was a baby after all. She didn't 
want to see that final thrust, but she couldn't look away. And all this couldn't be 
happening, but it was. It was. 


Klaus flourished the splintered stake and with a smile of pure ecstasy started to 
bring it down. 


And a spear shot across the clearing and struck him in the middle of the back, 
landing and quivering like a giant arrow, like half a giant arrow. It made Klaus's arms 
fling out, dropping the stake; it shocked the ecstatic grin right off his face. He stood, 
arms extended, for a second, and then turned, the white ash stick in his back 
wobbling slightly. 


Bonnie's eyes were too dazzled by waves of gray dots to see, but she heard the 
voice clearly as it rang out, cold and arrogant and filled with absolute conviction. 
Just five words, but they changed everything. 


. 
"Get away from my brother." 


. 
Fifteen 


Klaus screamed, a scream that reminded Bonnie of ancient predators, of the 
sabertooth cat and the bull mammoth. Blood frothed out of his mouth along with the 
scream, turning that handsome face into a twisted mask of fury. 


His hands scrabbled at his back, trying to get a grip on the white ash stake and 
pull it out. But it was buried too deep. The throw had been a good one. 


"Damon," Bonnie whispered. 


He was standing at the edge of the clearing, framed by oak trees. As she watched, 
he took a step toward Klaus, and then another; lithe stalking steps filled with deadly 
purpose. 


And he was angry. Bonnie would have run from the look on his face if her 
muscles hadn't been frozen. She had never seen such menace so barely held in 
check. 


25 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
"Get... away... from my brother," he said, almost breathing it, with his eyes never 
leaving Klaus's as he took another step. 


Klaus screamed again, but his hands stopped their frantic scrabbling. "You idiot! 
We don't have to fight! I told you that at the house! We can ignore each other!" 


Damon's voice was no louder than before. "Get away from my brother." Bonnie 
could feel it inside him, a swell of Power like a tsunami. He continued, so softly that 
Bonnie had to strain to hear him, "Before I tear your heart out." 


Bonnie could move after all. She stepped backward. 


"I told you!" screamed Klaus, frothing. Damon didn't acknowledge the words in 
any way. His whole being seemed focused on Klaus's throat, on his chest, on the 
beating heart inside that he was going to tear out. 


Klaus picked up the unbroken lance and rushed him. 


In spite of all the blood, the blond man seemed to have plenty of strength left. 
The rush was sudden, violent, and almost inescapable. Bonnie saw him thrust the 
lance at Damon and shut her eyes involuntarily, and then opened them an instant later 
as she heard the flurry of wings. 


Klaus had plunged right through the spot where Damon had been, and a black 
crow was soaring upward while a single feather floated down. As Bonnie stared, 
Klaus's rush took him into the darkness beyond the clearing and he disappeared. 


Dead silence fell in the wood. 


Bonnie's paralysis broke slowly, and she first stepped, and then ran to where 
Stefan lay. He didn't open his eyes at her approach; he seemed unconscious. She 
knelt beside him. And then she felt a sort of horrible calm creep over her, like 
someone who has been swimming in ice water and at last feels the first undeniable 
signs of hypothermia. If she hadn't had so many successive shocks already, she 


. 
might have fled screaming or dissolved into hysterics. But as it was, this was simply 
the last step, the last little slide into unreality. Into a world that couldn't be, but was. 


might have fled screaming or dissolved into hysterics. But as it was, this was simply 
the last step, the last little slide into unreality. Into a world that couldn't be, but was. 


She'd never seen anybody hurt like this. Not even Mr. Tanner, and he had died of 
his wounds. Nothing Mary had ever said could help fix this. Even if they'd had 
Stefan on a stretcher outside an operating room, it wouldn't have been enough. 


In that state of dreadful calm she looked up to see a flutter of wings blur and 
shimmer in the moonlight. Damon stood beside her, and she spoke quite collectedly 
and rationally. 


"Will giving him blood help?" 


26 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
He didn't seem to hear her. His eyes were all black, all pupil. That barely leashed 
violence, that sense of ferocious energy held back, was gone. He knelt and touched 
the dark head on the ground. 


"Stefan?" 


Bonnie shut her eyes. 


Damon's scared, she thought. Damon's scared-Damon!-and oh, God, I don't 
know what to do. There's nothing to do-and it's all over and we're all lost and 
Damon is scared for Stefan. He isn't going to take care of things and he hasn't got a 
solution and somebody's got to fix this. And oh, God, please help me because I'm 
so frightened and Stefan's dying and Meredith and Matt are hurt and Klaus is going 
to come back. 


She opened her eyes to look at Damon. He was white, his face looking terrifyingly 
young at that moment, with those dilated black eyes. 


"Klaus is coming back," Bonnie said quietly. She wasn't afraid of him anymore. 
They weren't a centuries-old hunter and a seventeen-year-old human girl, sitting here 
at the edge of the world. 


They were just two people, Damon and Bonnie, who had to do the best they 
could. 


"I know," Damon said. He was holding Stefan's hand, looking completely 
unembarrassed about it, and it seemed quite logical and sensible. Bonnie could feel 
him sending Power into Stefan, could also feel that it wasn't enough. 


"Would blood help him?" 


"Not much. A little, maybe." 


"Anything that helps at all we've got to try." 


Stefan whispered, "No." 


Bonnie was surprised. She'd thought he was unconscious. But his eyes were open 
now, open and alert and smoldering green. They were the only alive thing about him. 


"Don't be stupid," Damon said, his voice hardening. He was gripping Stefan's 
hand until his knuckles whitened. "You're badly hurt." 


. 
"I won't break my promise." That immovable stubbornness was in Stefan's voice, 
in his pale face. And when Damon opened his mouth again, undoubtedly to say that 
Stefan would break it and like it or Damon would break his neck, Stefan added, 
"Especially when it won't do any good." 


"I won't break my promise." That immovable stubbornness was in Stefan's voice,

in his pale face. And when Damon opened his mouth again, undoubtedly to say that 
Stefan would break it and like it or Damon would break his neck, Stefan added, 
"Especially when it won't do any good." 

Only the truth would do. And Stefan was telling the truth. 

He was still looking at his brother, who was looking back, all that fierce, furious 
attention focused on Stefan as it had been focused on Klaus earlier. As if somehow 
that would help. 

"I'm not badly hurt, I'm dead," Stefan said brutally, his eyes locked on Damon's. 
Their last and greatest struggle of wills, Bonnie thought. "And you need to get 
Bonnie and the others out of here." 

"We won't leave you," Bonnie intervened. That was the truth; she could say that. 

"You have to!" Stefan didn't glance aside, didn't look away from his brother. 
"Damon, you know I'm right. Klaus will be here any minute. Don't throw your life 
away. Don't throw their lives away." 

"I don't give a damn about their lives," Damon hissed. The truth also, Bonnie 
thought, curiously unoffended. There was only one life Damon cared about here, 
and it wasn't his own. 

"Yes, you do!" Stefan flared back. He was hanging on to Damon's hand with just 
as fierce a grip, as if this was a contest and he could force Damon to concede that 
way. "Elena had a last request; well, this is mine. You have Power, Damon. I want 
you to use it to help them." 

"Stefan..." Bonnie whispered helplessly. 

"Promise me," Stefan said to Damon, and then a spasm of pain twisted his face. 

For uncountable seconds Damon simply looked down at him. Then he said, "I 
promise," quick and sharp as the stroke of a dagger. He let go of Stefan's hand and 
stood, turning to Bonnie. "Come on." 

"We can't leave him..." 

"Yes, we can." There was nothing young about Damon's face now. Nothing 
vulnerable. "You and your human friends are leaving here, permanently. I am coming 
back." 

Bonnie shook her head. She knew, dimly, that Damon wasn't betraying Stefan, 
that it was some case of Damon putting Stefan's ideals above Stefan's life, but it was 
all too abstruse and incomprehensible to her. She didn't understand it and she didn't 
want to. All she knew was that Stefan couldn't be left lying there. 

"You're coming now," Damon said, reaching for her, the steely ring back in his 
voice. Bonnie prepared herself for a fight, and then something happened that made 

28 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 

all their debating meaningless. There was a crack like a giant whip and a flash like 
daylight, and Bonnie was blinded. When she could see through the afterimage, her 
eyes flew to the flames that were licking up from a newly blackened hole at the base 
of a tree. 

all their debating meaningless. There was a crack like a giant whip and a flash like 
daylight, and Bonnie was blinded. When she could see through the afterimage, her 
eyes flew to the flames that were licking up from a newly blackened hole at the base 
of a tree. 

Bonnie's eye darted to him next, as the only other thing moving in the clearing. He 
was waving the bloody white ash stake he'd pulled out of his own back like a gory 
trophy. 

Lightning rod, thought Bonnie illogically, and then there was another crash. 

It stabbed down from an empty sky, in huge blue-white forks that lit everything 
like the sun at noon. Bonnie watched as one tree and then another was hit, each one 
closer than the last. Flames licked up like hungry red goblins among the leaves. 

Two trees on either side of Bonnie exploded, with cracks so loud that she felt 
rather than heard it, a piercing pain in her eardrums. Damon, whose eyes were more 
sensitive, threw up a hand to protect them. 

Then he shouted "Klaus!" and sprang toward the blond man. He wasn't stalking 
now; this was the deadly race of attack. The burst of killing speed of the hunting cat 
or the wolf. 

Lightning caught him in midspring. 

Bonnie screamed as she saw it, jumping to her feet. There was a blue flash of 
superheated gases and a smell of burning, and then Damon was down, lying 
motionless on his face. Bonnie could see tiny wisps of smoke rise from him, just as 
they did from the trees. 

Speechless with horror, she looked at Klaus. 

He was swaggering through the clearing, holding his bloody stick like a golf club. 
He bent down over Damon as he passed, and smiled. Bonnie wanted to scream 
again, but she didn't have the breath. There didn't seem to be any air left to breathe. 

"I'll deal with you later," Klaus told the unconscious Damon. Then his face tipped 
up toward Bonnie. 

"You," he said, "I'm going to deal with right now." 

It was an instant before she realized he was looking at Stefan, and not her. Those 
electric blue eyes were fixed on Stefan's face. They moved to Stefan's bloody 
middle. 

29 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
"I'm going to eat you now, Salvatore." 
Bonnie was all alone. The only one left standing. And she was afraid. 
But she knew what she had to do. 
She let her knees collapse again, dropping to the ground beside Stefan. 
And this is how it ends, she thought. You kneel beside your knight and then you 


face the enemy. 
. 
She looked at Klaus and moved so that she was shielding Stefan. He seemed to 


notice her for the first time, and frowned as if he'd found a spider in his salad. 
Firelight flickered orange-red on his face.

Firelight flickered orange-red on his face. 
"No." 


And this is how the ending starts. Like this, so simply, with one word, and you're 
going to die on a summer night. A summer night when the moon and stars are 
shining and bonfires burn like the flames the Druids used to summon the dead. 


"Bonnie, go," Stefan said painfully. "Get out while you can." 


"No," Bonnie said. I'm sorry, Elena, she thought. I can't save him. This is all I can 
do. 
"Get out of the way," Klaus said through his teeth. 
"No." She could wait and let Stefan die this way, instead of with Klaus's teeth in 


his throat. It might not seem like much of a difference, but it was the most she could 
offer. 
"Bonnie..." Stefan whispered. 
"Don't you know who I am, girl? I've walked with the devil. If you move, I'll let 
you die quickly." 
Bonnie's voice had given out. She shook her head. 


Klaus threw back his own head and laughed. A little more blood trickled out, too. 
"All right," he said. "Have it your own way. Both of you go together." 
Summer night, Bonnie thought. The solstice eve. When the line between worlds is 


30 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
so thin. 
"Say good night, sweetheart." 
No time to trance, no time for anything. Nothing except one desperate appeal. 
"Elena!" Bonnie screamed. "Elena! Elena!" 
Klaus recoiled. 
For an instant, it seemed as if the name alone had the power to alarm him. Or as if 
he expected something to respond to Bonnie's cry. He stood, listening. 


Bonnie drew on her powers, putting everything she had into it, throwing her need 
and her call out into the void. 
And felt... nothing. 
Nothing disturbed the summer night except the crackling sound of flames. Klaus 
turned back to Bonnie and Stefan, and grinned. 
Then Bonnie saw the mist creeping along the ground. 
No-it couldn't be mist. It must be smoke from the fire. But it didn't behave like 
either. It was swirling, rising in the air like a tiny whirlwind or dust devil. It was

gathering into a shape roughly the size of a man. 
gathering into a shape roughly the size of a man. 
Mist was flowing out of the ground, between the trees. Pools of it, each separate 


and distinct. Bonnie, staring mutely, could see through each patch, could see the 
flames, the oak trees, the bricks of the chimney. Klaus had stopped smiling, stopped 
moving, and was watching too. 

Bonnie turned to Stefan, unable to even frame the question. 
"Unquiet spirits," he whispered huskily, his green eyes intent. "The solstice." 
And then Bonnie understood. 
They were coming. From across the river, where the old cemetery lay. From the 


woods, where countless makeshift graves had been dug to dump bodies in before 
they rotted. The unquiet spirits, the soldiers who had fought here and died during the 
Civil War. A supernatural host answering the call for help. 

They were forming all around. There were hundreds of them. 

31 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
Bonnie could actually see faces now. The misty outlines were filling in with pale 
hues like so many runny watercolors. She saw a flash of blue, a glimmer of gray. 
Both Union and Confederate troops. Bonnie glimpsed a pistol thrust into a belt, the 
glint of an ornamented sword. Chevrons on a sleeve. A bushy dark beard; a long, 
well-tended white one. A small figure, child size, with dark holes for eyes and a drum 
hanging at thigh level. 


"Oh, my God," she whispered. "Oh, God." It wasn't swearing. It was something 
like a prayer. 


Not that she wasn't frightened of them, because she was. It was every nightmare 
she'd ever had about the cemetery come true. Like her first dream about Elena, when 
things came crawling out of the black pits in the earth; only these things weren't 
crawling, they were flying, skimming and floating until they swirled into human form. 
Everything that Bonnie had ever felt about the old graveyard-that it was alive and 
full of watching eyes, that there was some Power lurking behind its waiting stillness 
-was proving true. The earth of Fell's Church was giving up its bloody memories. 
The spirits of those who'd died here were walking again. 


And Bonnie could feel their anger. It frightened her, but another emotion was 
waking up inside her, making her catch her breath and clench tighter on Stefan's 
hand. Because the misty army had a leader. 


One figure was floating in front of the others, closest to the place where Klaus 
stood. It had no shape or definition as yet, but it glowed and scintillated with the pale 
golden light of a candle flame. Then, before Bonnie's eyes, it seemed to take on 
substance from the air, shining brighter and brighter every minute with an unearthly 
light. It was brighter than the circle of fire. It was so bright that Klaus leaned back 
from it and Bonnie blinked, but when she turned at a low sound, she saw Stefan 
staring straight into it, fearlessly, with wide-open eyes. And smiling, so faintly, as if 


. 
glad to have this be the last thing he saw. 


glad to have this be the last thing he saw. 


Klaus dropped the stake. He had turned away from Bonnie and Stefan to face the 
being of light that hung in the clearing like an avenging angel. Golden hair streaming 
back in an invisible wind, Elena looked down on him. 


"She came," Bonnie whispered. 


"You asked her to," Stefan murmured. His voice trailed off into a labored breath, 
but he was still smiling. His eyes were serene. 


"Stand away from them," Elena said, her voice coming simultaneously to Bonnie's 
ears and her mind. It was like the chiming of dozens of bells, distant and close up at 
once. "It's over now, Klaus." 


But Klaus rallied quickly. Bonnie saw his shoulders swell with a breath, noticed 


32 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
for the first time the hole in the back of the tan raincoat where the white ash stake 
had pierced him. It was stained dull red, and new blood was flowing now as Klaus 
flung out his arms. 


"You think I'm afraid of you?" he shouted. He spun around, laughing at all the 
pallid forms. "You think I'm afraid of any of you? You're dead! Dust on the wind! 
You can't touch me!" 


"You're wrong," Elena said in her wind-chime voice. 


"I'm one of the Old Ones! An Original! Do you know what that means?" Klaus 
turned again, addressing all of them, his unnaturally blue eyes seeming to catch some 
of the red glow of the fire. "I've never died. Every one of you has died, you gallery 
of spooks! But not me. Death can't touch me. I am invincible!" 


The last word came in a shout so loud it echoed among the trees. Invincible... 
invincible... invincible. Bonnie heard it fading into the hungry sound of the fire. 


Elena waited until the last echo had died. Then she said, very simply, "Not quite." 
She turned to look at the misty shapes around her. "He wants to spill more blood 
here." 


A new voice spoke up, a hollow voice that ran like a trickle of cold water down 
Bonnie's spine. "There's been enough killing, I say." It was a Union soldier with a 
double row of buttons on his jacket. 


"More than enough," said another voice, like the boom of a faraway drum. A 
Confederate holding a bayonet. 


"It's time somebody stopped it"-an old man in home-dyed butternut cloth. 


"We can't let it go on"-the drummer boy with the black holes for eyes. 


"No more blood spilled!" Several voices took it up at once. "No more killing!" 
The cry passed from one to another, until the swell of sound was louder than the 
roar of the fire. "No more blood!" 


"You can't touch me! You can't kill me!" 


. 
"Let's take 'im, boys!" 


"Let's take 'im, boys!" 


"You can't kill me! I'm immortal!" 


The tornado swept away into the darkness beyond Bonnie's sight. Following it 
was a trail of ghosts like a comet's tail, shooting off into the night sky. 


"Where are they taking him?" Bonnie didn't mean to say it aloud; she just blurted 
it out before she thought. But Elena heard. 


33 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
"Where he won't do any harm," she said, and the look on her face stopped 
Bonnie from asking any other questions. 

There was a squealing, bleating sound from the other side of the clearing. Bonnie 
turned and saw Tyler, in his terrible part-human, part-animal shape, on his feet. There 
was no need for Caroline's club. He was staring at Elena and the few remaining 
ghostly figures and gibbering. 

"Don't let them take me! Don't let them take me too!" 

Before Elena could speak, he had spun around. He regarded the fire, which was 
higher than his own head, for an instant, then plunged right through it, crashing into 
the forest beyond. Through a parting of the flames, Bonnie saw him drop to the 
ground, beating out flames on himself, then rise and run again. Then the fire flared up 
and she couldn't see anything more. 

But she'd remembered something: Meredith-and Matt. Meredith was lying 
propped up, her head in Caroline's lap, watching. Matt was still on his back. Hurt, 
but not so badly hurt as Stefan. 

"Elena," Bonnie said, catching the bright figure's attention, and then she simply 
looked at him. 

The brightness came closer. Stefan didn't blink. He looked into the heart of the 
light and smiled. "He's been stopped now. Thanks to you." 

"It was Bonnie who called us. And she couldn't have done it at the right place and 
the right time without you and the others." 

"I tried to keep my promise." 

"I know, Stefan." 

Bonnie didn't like the sound of this at all. It sounded too much like a farewell-a 
permanent one. Her own words floated back to her: He might go to another place 
or-or just go out. And she didn't want Stefan to go anywhere. Surely anyone who 
looked that much like an angel... 


"Elena," she said, "can't you-do something? Can't you help him?" Her voice 
was shaking. 

"Elena," she said, "can't you-do something? Can't you help him?" Her voice 
was shaking. 

"I can do something," she said. "But I don't know if it's the kind of help he 
wants." She turned back to Stefan. "Stefan, I can cure what Klaus did. Tonight I 
have that much Power. But I can't cure what Katherine did." 

Bonnie's numbed brain struggled with this for a while. What Katherine did-but 

34 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
Stefan had recovered months ago from Katherine's torture in the crypt. Then she 
understood. What Katherine had done was make Stefan a vampire. 


"It's been too long," Stefan was saying to Elena. "If you did cure it, I'd be a pile 
of dust." 


"Yes." Elena didn't smile, just went on looking at him steadily. "Do you want my 
help, Stefan?" 


"To go on living in this world in the shadows..." Stefan's voice was a whisper 
now, his green eyes distant. Bonnie wanted to shake him. Live, she thought to him, 
but she didn't dare say it for fear she'd make him decide just the opposite. Then she 
thought of something else. 


"To go on trying," she said, and both of them looked at her. She looked back, 
chin thrust out, and saw the beginning of a smile on Elena's bright lips. Elena turned 
to Stefan, and that tiny hint of a smile passed to him. 


"Yes," he said quietly, and then, to Elena, "I want your help." 


She bent and kissed him. 


Bonnie saw the brightness flow from her to Stefan, like a river of sparkling light 
engulfing him. It flooded over him the way the dark mist had surrounded Klaus, like 
a cascade of diamonds, until his entire body glowed like Elena's. 


For an instant Bonnie imagined she could see the blood inside him turned molten, 
flowing out to each vein, each capillary, healing everything it touched. Then the glow 
faded to a golden aura, soaking back into Stefan's skin. His shirt was still 
demolished, but underneath the flesh was smooth and firm. Bonnie, feeling her own 
eyes wide with wonder, couldn't help reaching out to touch. 


It felt just like any skin. The horrible wounds were gone. 


She laughed aloud with sheer excitement, and then looked up, sobering. "Elena-
there's Meredith, too-" 


The bright being that was Elena was already moving across the clearing. Meredith 
looked up at her from Caroline's lap. 


"Hello, Elena," she said, almost normally, except that her voice was so weak. 


. 
Elena bent and kissed her. The brightness flowed again, encompassing Meredith. 
And when it faded, Meredith stood up on her own two feet. 


Elena bent and kissed her. The brightness flowed again, encompassing Meredith. 
And when it faded, Meredith stood up on her own two feet. 


Then she went to Damon. 


35 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
He was still lying where he had fallen. The ghosts had passed over him, taking no 
notice of him. Elena's brightness hovered over him, one shining hand reaching to 
touch his hair. Then she bent and kissed the dark head on the ground. 

As the sparkling light faded, Damon sat up and shook his head. He saw Elena and 
went still, then, every movement careful and self-contained, stood up. He didn't say 
anything, only looked as Elena turned back to Stefan. 

He was silhouetted against the fire. Bonnie had scarcely noticed how the red glow 
had grown so that it almost eclipsed Elena's gold. But now she saw it and felt a thrill 
of alarm. 

"My last gift to you," Elena said, and it began to rain. 

Not a thunder-and-lightning storm, but a thorough pattering rain that soaked 
everything-Bonnie included-and doused the fire. It was fresh and cool, and it 
seemed to wash all the horror of the last hours away, cleansing the glade of 
everything that had happened there. Bonnie tilted her face up to it, shutting her eyes, 
wanting to stretch out her arms and embrace it. At last it slackened and she looked 
again at Elena. 

Elena was looking at Stefan, and there was no smile on her lips now. The 
wordless sorrow was back in her face. 

"It's midnight," she said. "And I have to go." 

Bonnie knew instantly, at the sound of it, that "go" didn't just mean for the 
moment. "Go" meant forever. Elena was going somewhere that no trance or dream 
could reach. 

And Stefan knew it too. 

"Just a few more minutes," he said, reaching for her. 

"I'm sorry-" 

"Elena, wait-I need to tell you-" 

"I can't!" For the first time the serenity of that bright face was destroyed, showing 
not only gentle sadness but tearing grief. "Stefan, I can't wait. I'm so sorry." It was 
as if she were being pulled backward, retreating from them into some dimension that 
Bonnie could not see. Maybe the same place Honoria went when her task was 
finished, Bonnie thought. To be at peace. 

But Elena's eyes didn't look as if she were at peace. They clung to Stefan, and she 
reached out her hand toward his, hopelessly. They didn't touch. Wherever Elena was 
being pulled was too far away. 


"Elena-please!" It was the voice Stefan had called her with in his room. As if his 
heart was breaking. 

36 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
"Elena-please!" It was the voice Stefan had called her with in his room. As if his 
heart was breaking. 

"Stefan," Elena called again, but her voice came as if from a long distance. The 
brightness was almost gone. Then, as Bonnie stared through helpless tears, it winked 
out. 

Leaving the clearing silent once again. They were all gone, the ghosts of Fell's 
Church who had walked for one night to keep more blood from being spilled. The 
bright spirit that had led them had vanished without a trace, and even the moon and 
stars were covered by clouds. 

Bonnie knew that the wetness on Stefan's face wasn't due to the rain that was still 
splashing down. 

He was standing, chest heaving, looking at the last place where Elena's brightness 
had been seen. And all the longing and the pain Bonnie had glimpsed on his face at 
times before was nothing to what she saw now. 

"It isn't fair," she whispered. Then she shouted it to the sky, not caring who she 
was addressing. "It isn't fair!" 

Stefan had been breathing more and more quickly. Now he lifted his face too, not 
in anger but in unbearable pain. His eyes were searching the clouds as if he might 
find some last trace of golden light, some flicker of brightness there. He couldn't. 
Bonnie saw the spasm go through him, like the agony of Klaus's stake. And the cry 
that burst out of him was the most terrible thing she'd ever heard. "Elena!" 


Sixteen 

Bonnie never could quite remember how the next few seconds went. She heard 
Stefan's cry that almost seemed to shake the earth beneath her. She saw Damon start 
toward him. And then she saw the flash. 

A flash like Klaus's lightning, only not blue-white. This one was gold. 

And so bright Bonnie felt that the sun had exploded in front of her eyes. All she 
could make out for several seconds were whirling colors. And then she saw 
something in the middle of the clearing, near the chimney stack. Something white, 
shaped like the ghosts, only more solid looking. Something small and huddled that 
had to be anything but what her eyes were telling her it looked like. 

Because it looked like a slender naked girl trembling on the forest floor. A girl 
with golden hair. 

It looked like Elena. 

Not the glowing, candle-lit Elena of the spirit world and not the pale, inhumanly 

37 


L. J. Smith: Vampire Diaries 04 - Dark Reunion 
beautiful girl who had been Elena the vampire. This was an Elena whose creamy skin 
was blotching pink and showing gooseflesh under the spatter of the rain. An Elena 
who looked bewildered as she slowly raised her head and gazed around her, as if all 
the familiar things in the clearing were unfamiliar to her. 


It's an illusion. Either that or they gave her a few minutes to say good-bye. Bonnie 
kept telling herself that, but she couldn't make herself believe it. 


"Bonnie?" said a voice uncertainly. A voice that wasn't like wind chimes at all. 
The voice of a frightened young girl. 


Bonnie's knees gave out. A wild feeling was growing inside her. She tried to push 
it away, not daring to even examine it yet. She just watched Elena. 


Elena touched the grass in front of her. Hesitantly at first, then more and more 
firmly, quicker and quicker. She picked up a leaf in fingers that seemed clumsy, put 
it down, patted the ground. Snatched it up again. She grabbed a whole handful of 
wet leaves, held them to her, smelled them. She looked up at Bonnie, the leaves 
scattering away. 


For a moment, they just knelt and stared at each other from the distance of a few 
feet. Then, tremulously, Bonnie stretched out her hand. She couldn't breathe. The 
feeling was growing and growing. 


Elena's hand came up in turn. Reached toward Bonnie's. Their fingers touched. 


Real fingers. In the real world. Where they both were. 


Bonnie gave a kind of scream and threw herself on Elena. 


In a minute she was patting her everywhere in a frenzy, with wild, disbelieving 
delight. And Elena was solid. She was wet from the rain and she was shivering and 
Bonnie's hands didn't go through her. Bits of damp leaf and crumbs of soil were

clinging to Elena's hair. 


clinging to Elena's hair. 


Elena gasped back, "I can touch you! I'm here!" She grabbed the leaves again. "I 
can touch the ground!" 


"I can see you touching it!" They might have kept this up indefinitely, but 
Meredith interrupted. She was standing a few steps away, staring, her dark eyes 
enormous, her face white. She made a choking sound. 


"Meredith!" Elena turned to her and held out handfuls of leaves. She opened her 
arms. 


Meredith, who had been able to cope when Elena's body was found in the river, 
when Elena had appeared at her window as a vampire, when Elena had materialized

in the clearing like an angel, just stood there, shaking. She looked about to faint. 


"Meredith, she's solid! You can touch her! See?" Bonnie pummeled Elena again 
joyfully. 


Meredith didn't move. She whispered, "It's impossible-" 


"It's true! See? It's true!" Bonnie was getting hysterical. She knew she was, and 
she didn't care. If anyone had a right to get hysterical, it was her. "It's true, it's true," 
she caroled. "Meredith, come see." 


Meredith, who had been staring at Elena all this while, made another choked 
sound. Then, with one motion, she flung herself down on Elena. She touched her, 
found that her hand met the resistance of flesh. She looked into Elena's face. And 
then she burst into uncontrollable tears. 


She cried and cried, her head on Elena's naked shoulder. 


Bonnie gleefully patted both of them. 


"Don't you think she'd better put something on?" said a voice, and Bonnie looked 
up to see Caroline taking off her dress. Caroline did it rather calmly, standing in her 
beige polyester slip afterward as if she did this sort of thing all the time. No 
imagination, Bonnie thought again, but without malice. Clearly there were times when 
no imagination was an advantage. 


Meredith and Bonnie pulled the dress over Elena's head. She looked small inside 
it, wet and somehow unnatural, as if she wasn't used to clothing anymore. But it was 
some protection from the elements, anyway. 


Then Elena whispered, "Stefan." 


She turned. He was standing there, with Damon and Matt, a little apart from the 
girls. He was just watching her. As if not only his breath, but his life was held, 
waiting. 


Elena got up and took a tottery step to him, and then another and another. Slim 
and newly fragile inside her borrowed dress, she wavered as she moved toward him. 
Like the little mermaid learning how to use her legs, Bonnie thought. 


. 
He let her get almost all the way there, just staring, before he stumbled toward her. 
They ended in a rush and then fell to the ground together, arms locked around each 
other, each holding on as tightly as possible. Neither of them said a word.

Bonnie watched unabashedly, feeling some of the heady joy spill over into tears. 
Her throat ached, but these were sweet tears, not the salt tears of pain, and she was

still smiling. She was filthy, she was soaking wet, she had never been so happy in her 
life. She felt as if she wanted to dance and sing and do all sorts of crazy things. 

Some time later Elena looked up from Stefan to all of them, her face almost as 
bright as when she'd floated in the clearing like an angel. Shining like starlight. No 
one will ever call her Ice Princess again, Bonnie thought. 

"My friends," Elena said. It was all she said, but it was enough, that and the queer 
little sob she gave as she held out a hand to them. They were around her in a second, 
swarming her, all trying to embrace at once. Even Caroline. 

"Elena," Caroline said, "I'm sorry..." 

"It's all forgotten now," Elena said, and hugged her as freely as anyone else. Then 
she grasped a sturdy brown hand and held it briefly to her cheek. "Matt," she said, 
and he smiled at her, blue eyes swimming. But not with misery at seeing her in 
Stefan's arms, Bonnie thought. Just now Matt's face expressed only happiness. 

A shadow fell over the little group, coming between them and the moonlight. 
Elena looked up, and held out her hand again. 

"Damon," she said. 

The clear light and shining love in her face was irresistible. Or it should have been 
irresistible, Bonnie thought. But Damon stepped forward unsmiling, his black eyes as 
bottomless and unfathomable as ever. None of the starlight that shone from Elena 
was reflected back from them. 

Stefan looked up at him fearlessly, as he'd looked into the painful brilliance of 
Elena's golden brightness. Then, never looking away, he held out his hand as well. 

Damon stood gazing down at them, the two open, fearless faces, the mute offer 
of their hands. The offer of connection, warmth, humanity. Nothing showed in his 
own face, and he was utterly motionless himself. 

"Come on, Damon," Matt said softly. Bonnie looked at him quickly, and saw that 
the blue eyes were intent now as they looked at the shadowed hunter's face. 

Damon spoke without moving. "I'm not like you." 

"You're not as different from us as you want to think," Matt said. "Look," he 
added, an odd note of challenge in his voice, "I know you killed Mr. Tanner in 
self-defense, because you told me. And I know you didn't come here to Fell's 


Church because Bonnie's spell dragged you here, because I sorted the hair and I 
didn't make any mistakes. You're more like us than you admit, Damon. The only 
thing I don't know is why you didn't go into Vickie's house to help her."

thing I don't know is why you didn't go into Vickie's house to help her." 

Memory swept over Bonnie. Herself standing outside Vickie's house, Damon 
standing beside her. Stefan's voice: Vickie, invite me in. But no one had invited 
Damon. 

"But how did Klaus get in, then-?" she began, following her own thoughts. 

"That was Tyler's job, I'm sure," Damon said tersely. "What Tyler did for Klaus 
in return for learning how to reclaim his heritage. And he must have invited Klaus in 
before we ever started guarding the house-probably before Stefan and I came to 
Fell's Church. Klaus was well prepared. That night he was in the house and the girl 
was dead before I knew what was happening." 

"Why didn't you call for Stefan?" Matt said. There was no accusation in his 
voice. It was a simple question. 

"Because there was nothing he could have done! I knew what you were dealing 
with as soon as I saw it. An Old One. Stefan would only have gotten himself killed-
and the girl was past caring, anyway." 

Bonnie heard the thread of coldness in his voice, and when Damon turned back to 
Stefan and Elena, his face had hardened. It was as if some decision had been made. 

"You see, I'm not like you," he said. 

"It doesn't matter." Stefan had still not withdrawn his hand. Neither had Elena. 

"And sometimes the good guys do win," Matt said quietly, encouragingly. 

"Damon-" Bonnie began. Slowly, almost reluctantly, he turned toward her. She 
was thinking about that moment when they had been kneeling over Stefan and he had 
looked so young. When they had been just Damon and Bonnie at the edge of the 
world. 

She thought, for just one instant, that she saw stars in those black eyes. And she 
could sense in him something-some ferment of feelings like longing and confusion 
and fear and anger all mixed. But then it was all smoothed over again and his shields 
were back up and Bonnie's psychic senses told her nothing. And those black eyes 
were simply opaque. 

He turned back to the couple on the ground. Then he removed his jacket and 
stepped behind Elena. He draped it over her shoulders without touching her. 

"It's a cold night," he said. His eyes held Stefan's a moment as he settled the 
black jacket around her. 

And then he turned to walk into the darkness between the oak trees. In an instant 
Bonnie heard the rush of wings. 

Stefan and Elena wordlessly joined hands again, and Elena's golden head dropped

to Stefan's shoulder. Over her hair Stefan's green eyes were turned toward the patch 
of night where his brother had disappeared.

"You wanted us all back together again!" Bonnie shouted at Caroline, and pulled 
the scandalized girl into the dance. Meredith, her dignity forgotten, joined them too.
